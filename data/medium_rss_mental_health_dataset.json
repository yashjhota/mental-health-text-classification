I wasn\u2019t lazy because I lacked ambition. I was lazy because starting felt impossible.\n\nThen I discovered something ridiculously simple \u2014 the 3-Minute Rule.\n\nAnd it changed everything.\n\nThe Lowest Point: My Turning Moment\n\nI remember this specific morning. My desk was a mess. Assignments were overdue. My clothes were everywhere. But instead of doing something, I was lying on my bed, binge-watching a productivity video \u2014 ironically.\n\nHalfway through that video, the speaker casually mentioned:\n\n> \u201cIf something takes less than 3 minutes, just do it. Don\u2019t plan. Don\u2019t think. Just start.\u201d\n\nThat hit me.\n\nI paused the video and stared at my room. My brain whispered:\n\n\u201cFolding that t-shirt on the chair will take less than 3 minutes\u2026\u201d\n\nSo I got up. Folded the t-shirt.\n\nIt was such a small thing.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t lying in bed anymore.\n\nThe Magic Behind 3 Minutes\n\nWe don\u2019t avoid tasks because they\u2019re hard.\n\nWe avoid them because starting feels overwhelming.\n\nThat\u2019s why this rule worked for me. It tricks the brain.\n\nInstead of telling yourself \u201cI need to study for 2 hours,\u201d you just say,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \u201cLet me study for 3 minutes.\u201d\n\nThe pressure disappears.\n\nNine out of ten times, once you start, you go way beyond those 3 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s like pushing a car \u2014 the hardest part is the first shove. After that, momentum takes over.\n\nHow I Used It in Real Life\n\n\ud83e\uddf9 Cleaning My Room\n\nInstead of saying \u201cUgh, I have to clean everything,\u201d I said:\n\n\u201cJust wipe the desk. 3 minutes.\u201d\n\nBefore I knew it, I had cleaned the whole room in 15 minutes.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Studying\n\nI told myself: \u201cJust revise one flashcard. 3 minutes.\u201d\n\nI ended up studying for 45 minutes without realizing.\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Replying to Emails\n\n\u201cJust open Gmail and respond to one message.\u201d\n\nThat one turned into five.\n\nWhy It Works (Even If You're Super Lazy)\n\nNo pressure = No resistance\n\nYou\u2019re not committing to hours. Just 180 seconds.\n\nQuick wins = Dopamine boost\n\nFinishing something small makes your brain feel successful.\n\nMomentum is powerful\n\n3 minutes becomes 10, then 30, then done.\n\nThings You Can Try Right Now\n\nHere are examples of things you can start with the 3-minute rule:\n\nMake your bed\n\nDo 10 push-ups\n\nWrite 3 sentences in your journal\n\nOpen that book you\u2019ve been avoiding\n\nDelete 5 unnecessary files from your laptop\n\nText someone you've been putting off\n\nFinal Thoughts: Small Steps, Big Changes\n\nIf you\u2019re someone like I was \u2014 stuck, unmotivated, always saying \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d \u2014 I want you to try this rule.\n\nNot tomorrow. Not later. Right now.\n\nPick one thing that takes less than 3 minutes and just do it.\n\nThen watch how your entire day \u2014 and eventually, your life \u2014 starts shifting.\n\nSometimes, it only takes 3 minutes to break the chains of laziness.","label":0,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@pteja9737\/how-i-overcame-laziness-using-a-3-minute-rule-0f56d863c814?source=rss------mental_health-5"}

Sathvik Reddy 3 min read \u00b7 Just now Just now -- Listen Share\n\nA reflection on what it means to keep going when tomorrow feels uncertain.\n\nImage by Dmitry Ratushny\n\nHope is the driver. We\u2019re all just vehicles.\n\nIt drives some to death, some to life, and some to a place where life and death carry no meaning.\n\nWhat exactly is hope? What gives me hope?\n\nIs it the belief that I will be free someday, or is it the quiet thought about the future being different from present?\n\nIs it the story I repeat to myself every day as a reason to live tomorrow when there was no point in living all the yesterdays?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the idea that all of this will change someday.\n\nHope can be many things. It\u2019s the feeling that things could be better.\n\nIt\u2019s the lifeline we reach for when everything else feels like it\u2019s slipping away.\n\nBut hope isn\u2019t always gentle.\n\nIt\u2019s not always kind.\n\nHope can also be like a sweet poison, giving us a slow death.\n\nHope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.\n\nHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\n\nThe two lines are from the movie Shawshank Redemption.\n\nTwo opposing truths from the same film.\n\nHope is a dangerous thing when we live with it. The same hope appears to be a divine thing when we live through it and finally stand in that beautiful moment we have been imagining all these days.\n\nWhen people struggle in life they feel like living in hell. When the same people become successful or peaceful someday, they will praise the life when they were struggling.\n\nIt\u2019s all the same thing. We are disturbed, frustrated, and irritated by things that are not understood yet. But one day, when we make a sense out of them, some of them seem to be so small, some beautiful, and some meaningful.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what life is about. A constant shift between what we can\u2019t yet understand and what we someday will.\n\nThe whole point is that we are unable to see the future.\n\nWe feel pain today if we think tomorrow will be painful.\n\nWe feel peaceful today if we think tomorrow would be happier.\n\nWe feel thrilled today if we think tomorrow will be exciting.\n\nOur emotions aren\u2019t just responses to our circumstances. they\u2019re tied to the stories we tell ourselves about the future.\n\nMaybe for the first time when people felt these things. They started to think that maybe of all the things, the pain right now was the only thing that should be thought about replacing with something that makes them feel better (cause it\u2019s pain and not a single one if given a chance, will choose to feel pain).\n\nSo, here was born hope. Tomorrow will be painful, but the day after may be better, and someday maybe we will be happy.\n\nI had hope from the moment I knew about hope. I even had it before, but maybe I just didn\u2019t know it was hope. It was there in every quiet moment I survived. A man without hope is either too happy or maybe trying to kill himself. Too happy is a tale to me. The only times in my life I felt it was true were when I was too drunk with my friends.","label":0,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@nsreddy1729\/hope-is-a-driver-were-all-just-vehicles-270628dbe653?source=rss------mental_health-5"}

{"id":"medium_ab576488","title":"Pt. 2: The Quiet Collapse","text":"Pt. 2: The Quiet Collapse Peak Afflatus 4 min read \u00b7 4 hours ago 4 hours ago -- Listen Share\n\nWhen self-awareness becomes self-harm\n\nThe Slow Drift\n\nFor years I felt myself sliding. Lacking any real sense of direction or purpose \u2014 when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re sailing, no wind is fair.\n\nI have spent most of my adult life abroad, searching for adventure and experience away from the crowds. Quietly satisfying myself with solo pursuits and quiet ambition, shaped not by attention, but by curiosity and contentment.\n\nSilent Accent\n\nI\u2019d found a niche in a business where I could play a big part while remaining low-key, balancing success with servitude. It was exciting to sense the possibilities that lay ahead, to feel part of something people were proud of.\n\nThe Cracks Appear in Perfectionism\n\nBut when personal vision began to butt up against demands, something shifted. My abnormally high conscientiousness clashed with a deep desire for autonomy, a pattern I was familiar with. Slowly, the grinding reality of work wore down my aspirations of greatness, polluting them with over-intellectualised, critical negativity. I knew this was bias. On paper, I had it good.\n\nI kept trying to pinpoint the change in myself, but it was a way of thinking that stretched back as far as I could remember, trying to be everything to everyone, but too self-critical and afraid to meet my own expectations.\n\nMy ego ideal turned my inner voice hostile, the auto-aggression seeping into everything I did. You could argue it drove me to try harder, but the cost was self-hate of epic proportions.\n\nThe Inner Erosion\n\nIt became a kind of learned helplessness, an apathy that started to rot my personhood. I didn\u2019t deserve this role; I was a hack. A consummate chameleon. An algorithm that could deliver results without instinct, without the spark of a true creative.\n\nThe opposing forces of believing I deserved more and feeling unworthy bred a visceral conflict. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the more I ruminated on it, the more I hollowed out my own sanity.\n\nCorrosion and Withdrawal\n\nLike an anode protecting a ship\u2019s engine, I tried to shield the business with my own degradation. Whether in silence or in meetings, I\u2019d attempt to steer things toward the greater good despite a strong aversion to confrontation. Over time, withdrawal became the safest harbour, and the hull heavy with weed.\n\nMy increasingly loud internal monologue was collapsing the scaffolding of self, passing up opportunity and growth for the mediocre comfort of the familiar. Misery loves company.\n\nWhen you feel you\u2019re no longer at the wheel and heading to someone else\u2019s destination, cutting off your nose to spite your face starts to feel like a legitimate solution.\n\nRighteous and Weak\n\nI\u2019d lost the youthful courage to go my own way, trapped instead in the obligations of senior ranks and expectations and a desire not to repeat patterns of running away. I was facing the wrath of my own indecision.\n\nMy values and integrity were at odds with the behaviour around me and I tried to suppress the inner conflict. It is business after all, and not mine at that. I\u2019d always advocated for individuals to work in the way that suited their strengths, accepting that while it wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d do things, it remained a path to their own results.\n\nOver time though, as others\u2019 methods began to affect my own, I wondered why I had to suffer their shortcomings. I had plenty of my own to deal with, and being good at sorting theirs had carved a rut I was stuck in.\n\nWhen I sensed the corporate machine gearing up to \u2018resolve\u2019 things, I took it as an affront. I\u2019d seen these processes rolled out before, and I wasn\u2019t about to be on the receiving end of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a humbling thing to feel both righteous and weak. The ego wants to go out guns blazing. The inner child is stricken with grief. The collision of both is messy.\n\nRoutine as Armour\n\nBeneath the surface of this unravelling, there was a survival mechanism. The rigour with which I followed routine was militant, an attempt to cope and overcome.\n\nThe same nutrient-dense homemade salad for lunch. The same brisk walk. The same non-fiction podcast rotation. The latter designed to educate and drown out the familiar internal slander.\n\nRoutine kept the wheels turning, kept me upright, even as everything else listed. It was an attempt at control while the rest of life slipped from my grasp.\n\nThe Revolt\n\nIt seeded in me a defiance I couldn\u2019t control. I was no longer an inmate \u2014 I was ready to go rogue.\n\nInstead of falling in line I stepped out, quite literally, of the building. Mind on fire with outrage, I\u2019d never demanded respect, but I wasn\u2019t about to suffer another moment of others\u2019 misguided self-aggrandisement.\n\nI had, for all intents and purposes, architected my own collapse. And I was about to spiral to depths unseen.\n\nDepersonalisation to the edge\n\nI was a deeply depressed robot, running on auto. Anhedonic. Whose was this body I was inhabiting? Why did I feel like a stranger to myself?\n\nI began to wonder who I was at all, as the running joke of my awful memory made me question what identity even meant without recalled experience.\n\nWho are you, when you forget?\n\nI had reached the point where walking out the door felt like the only honest act left. The last refusal and gesture of agency. But it was no longer a choice.\n\nThe collapse was only the beginning. The fall that followed was fast. Ferocious. Absolute.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to support my work visit ko-fi.com\/peakafflatus","label":1,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@peak.afflatus\/pt-2-the-quiet-collapse-71428b8d2dc1?source=rss------depression-5"}

{"id":"medium_3f918646","title":"How to Overcome Depression: Lessons that Helped me Heal","text":"Here are the lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way \u2013 lessons I hope might light the path for someone else.\n\n1. Acceptance\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to accept that something you\u2019ve always been taught to see as a weakness is now part of your reality. But accepting depression doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed \u2013 it means you\u2019re human. Depression is as common as the flu; just as anyone can catch a cold, anyone can experience depression at some point in life. There is no shame in it, and there is nothing wrong with you. Acceptance is the first and most healing step. Once you accept it, you\u2019ll be ready to take the steps needed to heal.\n\n2. Just go through it\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly painful to admit that you\u2019re in a dark place \u2013 but denying it won\u2019t make it go away. Trust me: the clouds will part, and the sun will shine again. The only way out is through. And when you come out the other side, you won\u2019t be the same \u2013 you\u2019ll be stronger, wiser, and free. A different version of you will emerge from the storm.\n\n3. Remind yourself that you don\u2019t want to feel this way\n\nEvery time you acknowledge that this pain isn\u2019t something you chose \u2013 and that your true desire is to feel better \u2013 you take a powerful step forward. That quiet but honest admission creates space between you and the suffering. It reminds you that this state isn\u2019t permanent, and it\u2019s not your identity. From that place of clarity, you\u2019ll find the strength to start doing whatever it takes to change your situation.\n\n4. Be careful who you talk to\n\nWhen I opened up to friends about my depression, I often ended up feeling worse. Sometimes, they\u2019d shift the conversation to their own, more dramatic stories \u2013 as if we were competing over who was suffering more. Other times, they\u2019d reinterpret my experience in a way that made it all feel like my fault. But in those moments, I didn\u2019t need analysis or comparison \u2013 I needed someone to simply validate my pain and help me find a way out of the darkness.\n\n5. Ask for professional help\n\nIt took me six therapists and a couple of years to find the one who truly understood me. Finding the right person can take time \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it. Don\u2019t give up on the search just because the first (or fifth) match isn\u2019t right. The right therapist won\u2019t just treat your symptoms \u2013 they\u2019ll build a relationship with you that becomes part of your healing. Keep looking until you find someone who sees you and walks the journey with you.\n\n6. Be patient\n\nHealing doesn\u2019t happen in a single moment \u2013 it\u2019s a process, and sometimes a messy one. Some days feel like progress, others feel like setbacks, and some therapy sessions can be harder than the last. But that\u2019s all part of the journey. Patience is what carries you through the darkest stretches toward the light at the end of the tunnel. Trust the process, even when it\u2019s slow.","label":0,"source":"https:\/\/afshari-ladan.medium.com\/how-to-overcome-depression-lessons-that-helped-me-heal-05e4b7159101?source=rss------depression-5"}
{"id":"medium_9240bad8","title":"Understanding High Functioning Depression \ud83d\udc9a","text":"Understanding High Functioning Depression \ud83d\udc9a Jahli Creations 4 min read \u00b7 Just now Just now -- Listen Share\n\nAn introduction guide to understanding, empathizing, or surviving with Persistent Depressive Disorder! \u2728\n\nWhat is Persistent Depressive Disorder or High Functioning Depression? This is the fairly new diagnosis for Chronic Depression. To be diagnosed you must experience a depressed mood or symptoms for multiple days\/phases for at least two years or more. Symptoms can include; a lack of manic or hypomanic episodes, poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration or focus, difficulty decision making, feelings of hopelessness, or unable to function. Keep in mind that, those suffering with PPD experience these symptoms to a slightly less degree so they can function more often than those with Major Depressive Disorder. Because of this, symptoms may be more mild and less obvious to onlookers.\n\nAnother important factor is that symptoms can not be an onset caused from substance or alcohol abuse and medical issues. There are no brain scans, blood tests, or other tests to determine PDD. It must be diagnosed by your medical professional after receiving treatment, asking questions, and problem solving.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some important facts and statistics regarding Persistent Depressive Disorder. Women are three times more likely to experience PDD than men while 3% of the U.S. population suffers from PDD. Those also struggling with Borderline Personality Disorder are 70% more likely to have PDD. It\u2019s also important to acknowledge that 80\u201390% of people will develop PDD at some point in their life, mostly developing in childhood, teenagers, or young adulthood. While that statistic may intimidate some people, acknowledge that there is no way to prevent PDD and you are not alone. The first symptoms (while mild) can look like; negativity, low self-esteem, overdependent, lack of self confidence, self doubt, feeling hopeless, or withdrawal. If you begin to experience these, make sure to seek treatment immediately.\n\nSo what causes Persistent Depressive Disorder? The actual cause is still unknown and yet to be determined. However, it has been contributed to a few causes such as; biology, brain chemistry, inherited traits, stress level, and trauma. When we look at brain chemistry, often those suffering with PDD lack serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine. It can be a combination of all three or one that is lacking. Researchers are still studying how PDD affects brain chemistry and brain development to find more correlations between the two.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve dived into what Persistent Depressive Disorder is, how to spot early symptoms, and the science behind it, let\u2019s address how we can cope with PDD. The first step is always to acknowledge your symptoms and seek counseling or medical treatment. Once you\u2019re diagnosed, you\u2019ll want to find ways to relieve and manage your stress. The most effective proven treatment for PDD is a combination of medication and talk therapy. The most common medication is antidepressants, also known as; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin- Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs). If you are against medication, talk to your provider about possible natural herbs and vitamins that can help you. It is crucial to always speak with your provider first because self medicating can lead to Serotonin Syndrome or an increase in anxiety and depression. Aside from talk therapy, other therapies can include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), and a couple of newer therapies called Cognitive Behavioral Analysis of Psychotherapy and Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT).\n\nWhat if medication and treatment does not have positive results? In worst case scenarios there is Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). These treatments are rarely recommended and are seen as a \u201clast resort\u201d option. It\u2019s also important to know that these treatments have severely negative and long lasting side effects. NEVER consider these treatments as a first option.\n\nIf you do not wish to seek medication or treatment, your care provider may also recommend; exercising, relaxing activities, healthy eating habits, building and maintaining a positive support system, and healthy sleeping habits. NEVER look to self medicate or abuse substances to cope. This can lead to a codependency or addiction which may worsen your symptoms. In emergency situations, call or text a crisis lane to get immediate help.\n\nIf you or a loved one are fighting Persistent Depressive Disorder, it\u2019s important to raise awareness, break the stigma, and advocate for mental health. Take a moment today to share your love and support for those struggling today, even if it\u2019s yourself. Remember that you or your loved ones are not alone. There are many resources, treatments, and steps that can lead to a fulfilling and beautiful life.","label":1,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@jahlicreations\/understanding-high-functioning-depression-e1cca195e32e?source=rss------depression-5"}

The pressure behind my eyes. The guilt of doing \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\nTurns out, it wasn\u2019t laziness.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t burnout.\n\nIt was anxiety \u2014 high-functioning, quiet, always-there anxiety.\n\nAnd I had no idea.\n\nThis is for anyone who seems fine on the outside, but inside? You\u2019re fighting to stay afloat in your own mind.\n\n1. I Over-Explained Everything\n\nI\u2019d rewrite texts three times.\n\nI\u2019d send paragraphs apologizing for things no one was upset about.\n\nI\u2019d add \u201cif that\u2019s okay!!\u201d or \u201cjust checking in, no pressure\u201d even when I was allowed to ask.\n\nAnxiety made me think I had to over-explain to be understood.\n\nBecause what if they read it wrong?\n\nWhat if I sounded harsh?\n\nWhat if I was \u201ctoo much\u201d?\n\n2. I Couldn\u2019t Relax \u2014 Even When I Was Doing Nothing\n\nI\u2019d finally get time off.\n\nBlanket. Show on. Snacks ready.\n\nBut my brain? Still running.\n\nDid I reply to that email?\n\nI should be planning next week.\n\nWhy am I resting \u2014 there\u2019s still so much to do.\n\nAnxiety doesn\u2019t always look like panic.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s sitting still but feeling guilty for it.\n\n3. I Got Irritated \u2014 Then Blamed Myself for It\n\nLittle things started bothering me.\n\nNoise. Plans changing. People being late.\n\nAnd I\u2019d react. Not loudly, just sharply. Then feel awful for snapping.\n\nAnxiety made me feel like I was always on edge \u2014 and like I had no right to be.\n\n4. My Sleep Was\u2026 Off\n\nSome nights, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n\nOther nights, I woke up at 3 a.m., wired and wide-eyed.\n\nHeart pounding. Thoughts racing.\n\nNo real reason. Just\u2026 alert.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t insomnia. It was my body being stuck in fight-or-flight \u2014 even while lying in bed.\n\n5. I Said \u201cYes\u201d to Everything \u2014 and Then Resented It\n\nNeed help with that project? Sure.\n\nWant to talk? Of course.\n\nCan you come even if you\u2019re tired? Yeah, no problem.\n\nI kept agreeing to things to avoid disappointing people.\n\nAnd then quietly feeling frustrated, overwhelmed, and drained.\n\nPeople-pleasing isn\u2019t always about being nice.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s fear dressed up as \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n6. I Was Always \u201cProductive\u201d \u2014 But Never Present\n\nI got things done. My to-do list stayed full.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t feel there.\n\nI wasn\u2019t enjoying it. I was just performing.\n\nProductivity became my coping mechanism.\n\nIf I was busy, I didn\u2019t have to feel the anxiety underneath.\n\n7. I Thought Asking for Help Made Me Weak\n\nEven when I knew I was drowning, I kept quiet.\n\nDidn\u2019t want to be a burden.\n\nDidn\u2019t want to \u201cworry\u201d anyone.\n\nDidn\u2019t want people to see me struggling.\n\nBut I was. Quietly. Constantly.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cI\u2019m not okay\u201d \u2014 because I thought not being okay meant I was failing.\n\nWhat Changed\n\nThere wasn\u2019t one dramatic breakdown.\n\nJust a slow realization: this isn\u2019t normal.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be this exhausted from doing the bare minimum of life.\n\nI wasn\u2019t lazy. I wasn\u2019t dramatic.\n\nI was anxious \u2014 and I didn\u2019t even know that\u2019s what it was.\n\nWhen I finally learned what high-functioning anxiety looked like, I cried. Not because I was scared \u2014 but because I finally had a name for the heaviness.\n\nIf This Is You Too\n\nYou\u2019re not alone.\n\nYou\u2019re not weak.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201coverthinking\u201d everything for fun.\n\nYou\u2019re just someone whose brain learned to stay on high alert \u2014 and that\u2019s not your fault.\n\nAnxiety doesn\u2019t always scream.\n\nSometimes it whispers, and we don\u2019t hear it until we\u2019re burned out, shut down, or completely exhausted.\n\nBut you can learn to listen earlier.\n\nAnd when you do \u2014 that\u2019s not failure. That\u2019s healing.\n\nEver experienced signs like these and didn\u2019t realize they were anxiety?

A lot of things are available instantly and real discomfort has become less common for many of us.\n\nBut, at the same time, many people feel more anxious, unmotivated or disconnected even when nothing seems wrong on the surface.\n\nIn his book, The Comfort Crisis, author Michael Easter talks about things that seem helpful but actually do harm and what we can do instead.\n\nSo many of us live in cities. We are drawn to places where there are opportunities, movement, people, and comfort. According to this book, it is actually rooted in our instincts. Our brains are wired to seek out environments that feel rich with resources or chances to grow or connect.\n\nBut what happens when we never leave that environment? What happens when life becomes all comfort, all convenience, all man-made city life?\n\nMost of us now live surrounded by artificial light and constant noise \u2014 cars, trains, footsteps above, traffic outside the window, maybe neighbors talking through thin walls. Even when we think we are used to it, our nervous systems are still reacting to it all the time.","label":0,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/walks-of-life\/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-modern-life-5999d0afc2e8?source=rss------anxiety-5"}
{"id":"medium_478a3cbe","title":"The Root of My Anxiety Wasn\u2019t What I Thought \u2014 It Was Me Not Trusting Myself","text":"Photo by Sage Friedman on Unsplash\n\nThe Root of My Anxiety Wasn\u2019t What I Thought \u2014 It Was Me Not Trusting Myself Vivi Fame 4 min read \u00b7 3 hours ago 3 hours ago -- Listen Share\n\nFor a while now, I\u2019ve wondered why I struggle to fully communicate \u2014 even in simple, everyday conversations with family. And recently, I think I uncovered a big part of the reason.\n\nIt\u2019s anxiety.\n\nNot the loud, panicked kind \u2014 but the subtle kind that hides in how I articulate my thoughts.\n\nI noticed that whenever I speak, I tend to rush. I talk so fast, jumbling my words, even when the message is clear in my head. Why?\n\nBecause I\u2019ve been afraid that people wouldn\u2019t have the patience to really listen. That if I take too long, or tell a story slowly, they\u2019ll lose interest or stop engaging. And if I tell a joke and it doesn\u2019t land? My mind spirals.\n\nAnother part of the anxiety comes from fear of not sounding \u201csmart enough.\u201d That maybe I won\u2019t use the right grammar or my words won\u2019t come out polished. So while I\u2019m speaking, I\u2019m also overthinking \u2014 and that jumbles everything even more.\n\nBut recently, I told myself something new:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to slow down and talk. No one\u2019s going to punch me for it.\u201d\n\nPeople speak at a regular pace all the time. They mess up, pause, take their time \u2014 and no one scolds them. So why should I expect less grace for myself?\n\nAnd even if someone does get impatient?\n\nThat\u2019s a them problem, not a me problem.\n\nBecause I know what I\u2019m saying.\n\nPhoto by Ashlyn Ciara on Unsplash\n\n\ud83d\udcad A Mindset Shift I Didn\u2019t Expect\n\nI used to tell myself that the reason I stumbled over my words was because I didn\u2019t know how to articulate my thoughts. But the truth is \u2014 I do.\n\nWhen I slow down, I speak better.\n\nWhen I write without rushing, I communicate more clearly.\n\nAnd I actually noticed that in the text I wrote just before this one \u2014 it was calm. Not chaotic. Not jumbled. It flowed. Because I chose to write without fear \u2014 without the rush to \u201cjust get it all out before I forget.\u201d\n\nEven as I was entering a keke that day, I had an idea I wanted to write down. But the seat I got didn\u2019t make it easy, and anxiety tried to creep in with this old fear:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to forget it. You won\u2019t be able to write it later.\u201d\n\nBut this time, I stopped that thought.\n\nI told myself, \u201cNo. I\u2019ll remember it. I trust myself.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that\u2026 I felt calm.\n\nNot just in my mind \u2014 in my entire body.\n\nPhoto by Good Faces on Unsplash\n\nWhat That Moment Taught Me\n\nThere\u2019s been so much internal chaos in me. And I realized \u2014 I was the one creating it.\n\nBecause the moment I treated myself like a smart girl \u2014 like someone who could actually control her thoughts and memory \u2014 I felt something I hadn\u2019t felt in a while:\n\nConfidence. Clarity. Calm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it all clicked.\n\nThe root of my anxiety wasn\u2019t just fear.\n\nIt was a lack of self-trust.\n\nIt was the belief that I couldn\u2019t handle things.\n\nThat I would forget.\n\nThat I wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 and never would be.\n\nI used to dress it up as humility, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt was self-doubt.\n\nAnd honestly, it was tearing me down.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f The Real Work: Trusting Myself\n\nNow I see that self-love isn\u2019t complete without self-trust.\n\nI have to believe that I can remember. That I do know what I\u2019m saying. That I am capable.\n\nBecause the way I treat myself \u2014 the thoughts I speak over myself \u2014 that\u2019s what sets the tone for how others treat me, and how I show up in the world.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nI am growing.\n\nI am learning.\n\nAnd it\u2019s showing \u2014 not just in my writing or speaking, but in the way I talk to myself.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not going to keep hiding behind fear of imperfection.\n\nI\u2019m not going to rush my words or doubt my thoughts.\n\nI\u2019m not going to dim my expression because I think I\u2019m not \u201cgood enough.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a clear difference between arrogance and confidence.\n\nAnd what I\u2019m walking in now \u2014 this is confidence.\n\nThe kind rooted in grace, growth, and truth.\n\nWith calm and courage,\n\nVera\n\n#TheRubyProcess #BecomingHer #ConfidenceJourney #OvercomingAnxiety #SelfTrustIsPower","label":1,"source":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@iamvivifame\/the-root-of-my-anxiety-wasnt-what-i-thought-it-was-me-not-trusting-myself-aab6c9a249f2?source=rss------anxiety-5"}
