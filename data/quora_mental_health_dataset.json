They can help you determine if you have depression and recommend treatment options.   Here are some tips for recognizing depression in yourself:   Pay attention to your mood. Are you feeling sad, anxious, or hopeless most of the time?   Notice changes in your behavior. Are you withdrawing from social activities, neglecting your responsibilities, or engaging in risky behaviors?   Track your physical symptoms. Are you experiencing changes in your appetite, sleep, or energy levels?   Consider your thoughts and feelings. Are you having negative thoughts about yourself or the future?   Don't ignore the warning signs. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to seek help.   If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please seek help immediately. You can call a suicide hotline in your area or go to the nearest emergency room.   Remember, you are not alone. Depression is a treatable condition. With the right support and treatment, you can feel better.\n\nDepression is a common mental health condition that can affect people of all ages.

How do you feel?   In depression you can feel tired constantly, even exhausted most of the time, even when you don\u2019t put in much effort   You can feel hopeless and even fall into feeling despair at your life and your situation, there seems no way out for you, nothing to look forward to   Restlessness is a sign of depression, where you can\u2019t sit still, you can also feel irritated, even agitated, like you are spoiling for a fight   Feelings of resentment, bitterness and anger at your situation and towards others can be common too   Another common feeling in depression is to feel \u2018zoned out\u2019 or \u2018out of it\u2019 often   3. What is your daily mood like?   Is your mood mostly; low, flat, dis-interested, apathetic and are you only focused on yourself?   Your moods might be all over the place and it seems very confusing to you   You can feel okay one minute, angry at something minor the next, then sad and weepy, then flat and disinterested shortly after   Then your mood might be normal and you wonder what all the fuss was about   Waves of a deep sadness can come over you in depression, where you want to cry openly, but you have to hide it   If someone else tries to tell you about their life, in general conversation, your mood can be; cold, uncaring and you can be very critical of them in your head   4. Are you behaving differently?   Are you withdrawing and isolating yourself from the world more and more?   Do you spend an increasing amount of time on your own, away from everyone, even people you live with?   Even around people you like, are you closing down, hiding within yourself and staying overly quiet more often than not?   This is not a peaceful, calm type of quiet, like you feel relaxed inside yourself, but a dull uncomfortable quiet, where you hope no one talks to you because you have no idea how to explain what\u2019s going on inside you   To stay isolated and on your own, you might make excuses to people why you can\u2019t go out, that are just not true, but you just don\u2019t care   But you could also be the opposite, where you are acting out around others in unusual or odd ways   Are you behaving in loud, disruptive and even obnoxious ways nowadays?   5. How much energy do you have?   Do you feel worn out often, like you are running on empty for no reason?   You might feel listless, weak or even exhausted often, even when you are putting in little effort to do anything   Having no energy can make you desperately want to relax to try and recharge for long periods, say on weekends, but no matter how much time you spend doing nothing, you can still feel exhausted   As well as having little or no physical energy, you can have next to no mental energy too   When you try to focus, think, make decisions and do your work, it can feel mentally tiring and exhausting   6. Are you sleeping poorly?   This seems to be more common than not; do you feel drowsy during the day and wide awake when it\u2019s time for bed?   Your body\u2019s time clock can seem to be all over the place in depression   Do you toss and turn for hours at night, with racing thoughts that just won\u2019t slow down?   By the time you do get to sleep, you might only end up sleeping for 2 or 3 hours before you have to get up   Maybe you have no problem falling asleep at night, but you wake up in darkness most of the time for no reason and you feel wide awake almost instantly   In other words, you struggle to stay asleep, either way, a lack of sleep sees you yawning and feeling over tired during the day   One other type of sleep problem in depression is where you can sleep for a long time, like 10 to 12 hours, yet you still feel over tired and drowsy when you get up   It hasn\u2019t refreshed you in any way   7. How motivated do you feel?   In depression, you can be so unmotivated often, that people accuse you of being lazy, but that is far from the truth   You can have no drive or enthusiasm, even for doing things you would always enjoy previously   Even when vitally important things need to get done, it can be an absolute struggle to get up and get going and take even the first step   You just seem to feel unmotivated about getting anything done and you don\u2019t care about the consequences   Everyday movements seem to be a struggle, like you are pushing against a huge resistance   Just getting off the couch and taking your first steps towards doing something can be a real struggle   People describe it like having to push through quicksand or a thick treacle   How did you go with these signs of depression? If you have even just one or two of them, it\u2019s wise to see your doctor or qualified health professional and tell them what you are dealing with   You could even write down what applies to you from above and show your qualified health professional   There is no shame in asking for help, we all need help in our lives, even the people around you who you think are bulletproof need help at times, they just won\u2019t admit it to anyone   You are not alone and there are plenty of treatment options for you   Your chances of recovery are also very good, good luck.

They quit calling friends, decreased communication with neighbors and service people. Gradually alone until the end. They begin to become clumsy, breaking items, stumbling, and having accidents. Their mind is too focused on their depressive state. Their home gradually becomes more cluttered and dirty, repairs are ignored. Mail remains unopened inattentive to their environment. Lack of \u2018being present\u2019. You will notice that their body is with you but emotionally and mentally they aren\u2019t engaged. They begin giving things away, nothing has sentimental value anymore. They become confused, forgetful, and apathetic towards both mundane and special events, even their favorite friends. Their speech pattern changes, mumbling, monotone, and barely audible. There is a noticeable lack of humor, their mouth takes a downturned expression. There is a vacant sadness in their eyes. Expression is one of despair. They begin talking about famous suicide victims while their interest towards the topic increases. They express acceptance or approval of suicide. Their vocabulary leads towards, or hinting at, the statement, \u2018\u2019There is no hope or future\u2019\u2019. They express an apathetic attitude towards everyone and everything. They lose the spark and liveliness from their eyes. They gradually develop a dull, lifeless look. The frequency of their smiles gradually decreases until there is a frozen, blank expression on their face of sadness. Their health problems increase and they don\u2019t seek answers or want to talk about it. They stop exercising and sleep more. The extremely depressed won\u2019t seek counseling but exhibit a \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019 persona, trying to fool everyone that they are GREAT, until the body is found.

I wanted to but couldn't because I was suffering down there and didn't know how to approach it.   It took everything from me. I lost myself and now I'm recovering on my own. It's difficult to manage without consulting anyone and curing it yourself. I fell prey to it for 1 year and I am getting better but I still get the symptoms once in a while.   I can study sometimes but now I can't focus. I oversleep and in classes, I feel sleepy. My grades have improved but not to the level it was b4 the depression. I lost my ability to talk openly but I'm trying. I can't talk to my male best friend as I used to. It's always awkwardness and I don't know. I miss the old me.

Small anxieties may culminate into depression if there is no vent available .Infact a very depressed person might not be found regularly as he\/she starts avoiding public appearances .But the basic signs start developing once a person is hit by anything abnormal .Just keep a tap of the deviation from normal behaviour of person .   Usually children and adolescents show signs by performing badly in their schools ,reamaining isolated ,no physical activity .   College teens have now started expressing their anxiety by social media ,whatsapp status (frequently changing ) ,alcohol ,smoking ,parties ,songs may be fast or may be very sad ones .   Mid aged people start eating more , avoid talking to family ,avoid gatherings ,unusual routine ,alcohol ,smoking .   Senior citizens start creating fuss about small things as they want to seek attention of their family ,chose to remain away from home ,try to make new friends of their age ,some of them even try to learn technology in order to be able to gel up with their grandchildren.Majority of senior citizens are neglected by their children and family and they fall prey to depression.   For instance ,when the first time I took leave to give my Engineering services exam ,my boss at IOCL would issue regular threats ,I was busy preparing so didn't give a damn to it .But when I returned back to work after that ,he told all the other staff and my co- officers to boycott me .No one used to speak to me .I was really unhappy .I bought a little labra pup and my world revolved around it .I started talking to him about every damn thing .   Second instance was when I was waiting for my relieving, as I was selected in ESE 2013 with an amazing all India rank of 7 ,in Delhi .Things were not very favourable. I had to go to head office of IOCL in greenpark everyday ,sit there from morning 10:30 to evening 4:30 only to hear that someone was on leave ,someone did not approve ,someone told to write a mail ,all sorts of excuses .I had no clue when would I be relieved ,it started making me anxious and worried each passing day .It's there that I decided I would prepare for UPSC .Sitting in those corridors I started reading basic books for UPSC .And it worked miracles .I started preparing for UPSC quite seriously.And see I have achieved it .   There are more such times when I fought to come out of the worrying situations including relationship storms .But the point I want to make here is not everybody can do this alone .I was fortunate to have some very supportive friends ,my husband ,my parents ,my brother but not all are blessed .From these instances I promised myself that I would always try to help people around me ,if nothing try to be approachable   A couple of days back ,I got a message from my maid's daughter,who was having suicidal tendencies .I tried to help her in the best possible way I could . Kept calling her regularly Called her to my home ,made her do yoga with me . Got her enrolled in python learning programme (she is pursuing computer science engineering from a private college) Her basic grievance was that no body is listening to her ,she felt she was completely useless ,no one wants her .In sometime she became quite calm and has again started her normal life . My only point here is just look around yourselves and listen to others ,be approachable and you can help a lot of people by being observant .You don't need to be a certified pychiatrist ,only a basic EQ not much IQ would help us to bring back our friends to normal .Keep communicating and keep a track of the lives of near and dear ones .Make them realise that you are there for them ,everytime and anytime .Help each other from coming out of this if you want to prevent the society from collapsing .This is a kind of social transformation and reformation the society is going through .   I urge that anybody who needs help with this can surely approach me .I shall try my best to get you out of it .   Best wishes \ud83d\ude0a   Webinar scheduled on 5th July by me .

I noticed that David wasn\u2019t engaged in the assignment he was supposed to be working on. I tried to go over an algebra problem with him. I barely understood what he was saying. When I questioned David if he understood what the professor was writing on the board, he didn\u2019t clarify.   Since I couldn\u2019t get David to focus, I decided to ask him if he was having a hard time keeping up with the class.   David says, \u201cNo Ms. Gonzalez, I haven\u2019t slept for three days.\u201d I asked him \u2018why\u2019 and he opened up about his family life. He said, \u201cMy mom left us (meaning his dad, and two siblings) but she keeps telling us she\u2019s coming back. She left my dad for another man and I know she\u2019s doing drugs. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll show up any day, she did promise to come back. I can\u2019t concentrate in my classes plus I\u2019m always sleepy.\u201d   I then ask David if he has any hobbies. Amazingly, he tells me that he likes to write. I get excited for him since I love writing myself.   Then I proceeded to tell David to write when he can\u2019t stop worrying about his mom coming back or whatever else bothers him. I told David that it\u2019s beyond his control what his mom is doing. I also told him a little about myself and how I used to cope whenever there was some type of hardship in my family while growing up.   Forget about Algebra at that moment!   I wanted to see David\u2019s face (he always looked down) and said, \u201cPlease pull your hair to the side so I can see your full face.\u201d David was a nice looking young man. I then said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hide your face, you are a nice looking young man. Now, please promise me that from now on whenever you feel depress, write about anything that comes to mind.\u201d   You might ask why I don\u2019t send these type of students to the counselor but the answer is that they simply won\u2019t open up. At least, not in this case.   I\u2019ve written about other students that face hardship and don\u2019t know how to cope. I am happy to say that these students do open up to me because they sense that I do care and also give them hope. In fact, most teachers do.   After I was wrapping it up to leave the classroom, the algebra teacher asked me if David did okay.   I told him, \u201cWell, David has family problems and hasn\u2019t slept in three days, he is very worried about his mother coming back home.\u201d He replied, \u201cI wonder why he never mentioned that to me.\u201d   This student was going through deep depression. The signs were there: not focused, not talking to anyone, no hope, almost broke down crying, no sleep, etc. Why do I know the signs, I\u2019ve gone through depression at that age myself.   Hope David\u2019s life improves and that he gets proper treatment for his depression.   Best wishes to all.\n\nI was sent to a math class to tutor a high school student.

An excuse for this is the constant \u201cI'm just tired.\u201d They just stop trying or feel as though they can't do anything so its not worth their time. Hopelessness and\/or helplessness- you feel life is not worth living, there is no hope for the future, Stagnation- They\/you don\u2019t want to get out of bed. ignoring your problems and thinking that by ignoring your problem it will go away but it won\u2019t. It just gets worse. Irritability and bitterness- Everything or anyone becomes a nuisance. They\/you lash out at everyone as if it were their fault you are depressed. Jealousy\/envy- They\/you almost hate anyone who seems to have a better life than yours and you resent them or feel jealous because you don\u2019t have what they have. Bouts of crying and sadness- You realize you have frequent crying spells, which is not how you used to be. You feel sad, empty or numb all the time and you dwell on your misery and can\u2019t seem to escape it Apathy, selfishness and fear\/cowardice- Many depressed people can often forget or choose to forget they have other people to live for hence why they need to get help but some people just choose to remain in their condition, not getting any help and not giving a damn about it. With regards to cowardice is kind of linked to apathy. Cowards are afraid of facing life, making decisions, growing up, taking ownership, and the list goes on. Withdrawing\/Not keeping in contact-this kind of goes along with lack of energy and motivation this person might not be texting\/posting as much as they used to or choose to stay away from people they know and be alone Lack of self-care- this person may not take care of themselves as they used to, whether thats not eating or even as little as not washing their hands. this one can be just a sign someone is lazy or that they might have depression. I have gotten lots of comments about number 12, and the definition of cowardice is lack of courage to face danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, failure, etc. so the fear to face ones problems could be defined as cowardice. Thats all I know just remember not all of these signs are indicators of depression just check in with people and look up more resources online. If you are facing depression please don't try to handle it on your own you probably need outside help.

Many people\u2019s depression manifest differently. Their symptoms can be a combination of the above. But usually you have to meet quite a few of these symptoms in order to be diagnosed properly.

My cuts finally caught my parent\u2019s attention and since they are the typical Indian parents who do not understand the word \u201cdepression\u201d, told me to stop whatever I was up to, I don\u2019t blame them, they have been raised in an environment, where they did not understand, It took time.   But things were getting worse every month, I would constantly be up all night, Puke before exams, I was loosing my friends, getting angry on small things, constantly staying at home, but feeling bad after seeing my friends who were partying out.   And one day, my boyfriend then, helped me to go to a psychiatrist, I wasn\u2019t very upfront with it, but i knew i needed help.   1 year of medicines and therapy later, I felt better, i felt like maybe maybe i can be okay.   My parents finally understood my situation, my mom accompanied to several of my therapy sessions.   But i am sorry I\u2019m going to end this answer in a sad note, I still don\u2019t feel out of depression, I won\u2019t say I am at the stage when i started.   I feel that depression is like a solid rock, that hits you in your gut out of no where, so you get hurt, you remove the rock, you try all the bandaids of the world, but it leaves a nasty scar, you\u2019re never the person before the depression.   You learn to smile, you learn to laugh, but inside you\u2019re always the person who is sad. You wouldn\u2019t want to die anymore, you want to live- specially for the people around you, you don\u2019t want to hurt them, but you lost your happiness way back.   In case anyone is facing depression, or is in my phase, I hope you find happiness, I hope you don\u2019t have to feel the way I feel.   To always hoping. :)\n\nSo, I was diagnosed with major clinical depression and general anxiety disorder (GAD) about 2 years ago, but i was facing it since the past 5\u20136 years.

I want to share a deeply personal story about my mental health journey and how Manastha has been a constant source of support and healing for me.   My first experience with Manastha dates back to 2020, when the world was turned upside down by the pandemic. Like many, I found myself battling anxiety and stress that began affecting my physical health. I knew it was time to reach out for help again.   When I needed therapy recently, my previous therapist wasn\u2019t available due to vacation. Manastha quickly assigned me a new, well-trained psychologist, and what amazed me the most was how effortlessly they passed on my case history. I didn\u2019t have to go through the emotional strain of retelling my story. The transition was smooth, compassionate, and thoughtful. I felt heard, understood, and cared for.   Every experience I\u2019ve had with Manastha has left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and less alone in my journey. And I want to share why Manastha might be the right choice for you too.   Why Manastha Stands Out:   1.  Affordable, Transparent Pricing : No hidden costs, just genuine care.   2.  Immediate Support within 60 Minutes : You can be connected with a therapist in as little as 60 minutes \u2013 because your mental health matters now, not later.   3.  Real, Uninterrupted Sessions : A full 60-minute session means ample time to explore, express, and heal \u2013 unlike some services that cut corners with shorter sessions.   4.  Expert Care  from  AIIMS  &  NIMHANS  Professionals: Manastha offers access to some of the most respected mental health experts in the country, ensuring you receive top-notch support.   5.  Professional  and  Compassionate Team : They don\u2019t just offer therapy; they build relationships. The extra sessions and extended validity they offered me when I needed it most were gestures of genuine kindness.   6.  Trusted by Global Leaders : There\u2019s a reason why top companies like  SAMSUNG ,  HCL ,  WIPRO ,  AMITY ,  TITAN , etc trust Manastha for their Employee Assistance Programs. Manastha\u2019s reputation for professionalism and client satisfaction is unmatched.   A few months ago, I decided to return to therapy, and I was amazed when they reconnected me with my previous therapist. It felt like reconnecting with an old friend who already knew my journey and was ready to help me continue it.   Manastha also have psychiatric services with experts from AIIMS and NIMHANS, and I\u2019m currently benefiting from that as well. Their commitment to comprehensive mental health care is truly remarkable.   If you\u2019ve been struggling silently, please know that help is just one step away. I\u2019m here to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to reach out.   We deserve healing. We deserve support. And we deserve to feel whole again.\n\nMANASTHA ONLINE COUNSELING: A Journey to Healing and Self-Discovery   Hello everyone,   I\u2019m  Surbhi , originally from India but currently living in Sweden.

Sunlight peeps into your room through a little crack in the window and you know it's time. Time to wake up, time to bid adieu to the darkness that emerged from the night before, the darkness that once witnessed you sleeping throughout, keeps you awake now. It begs you to stay a little longer and inhale its silence, because the voices inside your head decided to hit the mute button and are still too loud to bear somehow. They shout and remain silent at the same time, they make you wanna leave your body and disappear into a tiny speck of dust.   The 3 am that once haunted you, comforts you and the 3 pm that once made you laugh, chokes you everyday.   You feel the heat, but you don't feel warm. You feel cold, but you don't feel the calm. The wind blows in your face, but it refuses to dry the sweat inside you. It rains day and night, but your insides remain covered in dust. The sun shines everyday, but you freeze away piece by piece inside.   Every emotion that you once felt, crumples up like a piece of paper and you don't feel pain anymore. It's part of your system now. Like breathing, it's constant. You hardly notice it anymore. It introduces you to numbness, your new companion. Numbness, that makes you look directly into the eyes of people and say that you're okay. You say it a million times before you start believing it yourself.   You feel suffocated even when the air around you is composed of oxygen. You feel trapped even when all the doors and windows in your house are wide open.   You think about putting an end to it. Every second of everyday, you think about escaping. So you start running, you run like crazy. And you don't stop until you realize that you've lost your way back home, to yourself. But it's too late now, and you've come so far that you feel tired in your bones. So you just sit there and stare into nothingness.   You try to make sense of everything and nothing, all at once. It makes you go insane to the point where you resort yourself to alcohol, self harm and meaningless music, where there's no melody but only sounds. Sounds that distract you from your own thoughts. You meet yourself only when you get high. But the meeting is brief and the next thing you know, your body flushes it all out and makes you sober again. The hangovers hurt more than heartbreaks, yet your body craves for intoxication every second. You kiss more bottles than people and feel no regret, because nothing matters anymore.   Every night, the silence around you, instigates a tornado of thoughts inside your brain until you doze off. Every day, you force yourself to crawl out of the bed, and enter into the haunted days that consist of the same fucking monotonous routine where you scroll away your loneliness on your phone.   Everyday, you see the people around you. Smiling. Talking. Living. They all seem so happy and you ask yourself, why can't you be like them for once? You think for a long time and eventually stop searching for the answers. Your brain gives up and shuts down completely.   You do everything. You brush your teeth, you take baths, you eat, you pee, you read and you sleep. But every activity in your life loses its purpose.   You look everywhere but you see nothing. Not even a dead end.

In depression,   Nothing fascinates you anymore, nothing brings a smile to your face that's deep enough to touch your heart. You lose the urge to live, to wake up, to talk, to work.   Your senses pick the right stimuli but what's the use when it's perceived by your mind dully and negatively?   The filters of your mind are clogged.   Slowly, you ruin your body, lifestyle, and personality and the seldom realisation of it sinks you even further.   Depression is a vicious circle.   It strengthens itself because the more it ruins your life the less you have the urge to get back at it.   It starts because of one or few prolonged matters of grief or pain but then creates a reason-free existence and takes the entire life.   Ever heard about those warms which slowly feed on the host insect\u2019s body, become huge and then kill the host insect and take control of it's body?   For me, the most important thing in overcoming depression is to wake up from this nightmare of the present life.   Today, life is running, controlling, and ruining you the way it wants to. Life's the master and you are the servant.   You need a realization of life beyond now, the entire past, and future included.   What's left behind, what's lost, what's going, what could be avoided, my fault, I acted weak, I could have achieved that, I could have done that. Please, never ask yourself these questions as they will never let you wake up.   What's gone is gone, it wasn't yours, and it wasn't meant to be, Stop cursing or hating yourself. You weren't at fault, being depressed is not a choice.   The last thing you need is regret or guilt.   Also, Rome wasn't built in a day. Life wouldn't magically become better in one day, neither do you need to cast a magical spell on yourself.   All you need is a realization, a commitment, and baby steps toward life.   You need to look ahead and be strongly committed to taking over the control of life and circumstances.   I can still start fresh, I am still alive and active, I still have many opportunities in life, and life is still giving me another chance.   Restart the machinery and focus on small activities and not bigger goals.   If you can't get out of your bed the entire day, your present task isn't to start working a ten-hour shift, you need to get out of bed first and do two or three activities for the next few days.   Go out for a walk water plants, cook food, buy groceries, write a journal.   Then add more, slowly add more, and restart your life. Don't overload life at once.   With this, I have one more important suggestion.   Write a book and portray yourself as a wounded lion, the tough hero of a very challenging story.   Remember, the story of a superhero who is broke, has given up the urge to save the world, and is living a dead and meaningless life, but suddenly one event brings him or her back and they save the world.   Be that. Or see yourself as that. It's not an overestimation, at least you can save your world.   Write your miseries, don't be shy, and mention every bad thing life did to you.   What must the hero do now?   How must he fight back?   Write your past, and present and create a future you want with your pen or keyboard.   To shut the voice of your mind, you need simple and powerful activities like affirmations, chanting, gratitude, or deep breathing.   \u201cLife's good.\u201d   \u201cI am active and healthy.\u201d   \u201cI will fight life till the end.\u201c   \u201cC\u2019mon, you can't give up. \u201c   Make a list of affirmations and select one or two, chant mantras or bhajans in all your free time with utter faith in God. Make a target of chanting 10,000 times and then celebrate it by distributing food to the poor.   The moment you wake up, chant and start the day.   Don't run away from your thoughts, don't avoid, don't escape, You have the solution, you know the solution, it's either acceptance or karma, mostly it's the former. List them down, what needs to be done, what you have done, or nothing needs to be done now, Write that you are free from this aspect now.   Develop a fresh motto in life.   To live healthy and happy each day.   To bring happiness to the world.   To spread the message of love and peace.   To experience and explore life and the world as much as you can.   To give a contribution to a field.   Make a strict rule of \u201cNo negativity only positive vibes\u201d   No gossiping, no negative insulting people, good music, mild scent, cleanliness, no digging the past, no pressure or compulsion, no ego clashes.   Do take professional treatment if you suffer from depression, don't shy away, avoid or misjudge this disease. Also, sometimes medications are really helpful in giving you a lift from the severe breakdown, and you can surely slowly leave them with effort and intent.   Anubhav Jain\n\n\u201cSuffering appears to be a choice but only for those who aren't suffering.\u201d   One can only realize the pain and hopelessness of the other only if they have suffered from it in the recent past, rest, everyone picks it as weakness, lethargy, or a choice.   In depression,   Nothing fascinates you anymore, nothing brings a smile to your face that's deep enough to touch your heart. You lose the urge to live, to wake up, to talk, to work.   Your senses pick the right stimuli but what's the use when it's perceived by your mind dully and negatively?   The filters of your mind are clogged.   Slowly, you ruin your body,  Continue Reading\n\nDeependra Nyati ASO MEITY CGL 23, Ex-Software Engineer, IIIT Kota  \u00b7  Author has  71  answers and  1.6M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 1y\n\nI never wanted to answer this but seeing too many queries regarding this, so I had to.

I will tell you about the real depression how it looks like as I have seen it everyday for 6 years.   I am not a mental health expert.   I realized anybody literally anybody can go into such states. It\u2019s very very difficult to tell how you get into such state of mind and much more difficult to treat. Some relate it to hormones, some to situations but the exact reason will always be unknown.   Depression can have many forms but I will tell you what I have seen very closely.   Let me tell you how you go into depression and what depression is: You face some loss either in your business or you are very stressed in your job or something else. You are unable to sleep, you are anxious now about your sleep as well. You start taking sleeping pills, deterioration starts here, a point comes when even sleeping pills don\u2019t work, you had hidden that from your family but now you have no option but to take help. You start seeking help from your relatives, they don\u2019t take you seriously, mock at you because even they haven\u2019t seen such things. They take it lightly. You start feeling more depressed, your state of mind worsens. You feel you are not performing according to your expectations or things haven\u2019t worked out as you planned, you consider yourself as a failure. Shit starts getting serious, people try to console you, make you happy, it\u2019s all blurry, you hear nothing, you are in your own state of mind, you cannot even express where you are, depressive thoughts goes on and on, you have no control over them. Fear of future is the dominating thought, you are just stuck, stuck at your failures, again and again saying sorry by saying \u201cI was a complete failure, please forgive me, please take care of your mother\u201d, you have forgotten all your abilities. Your relatives\/friends might have said something in the past in a taunting manner and you took it personally (It\u2019s pretty obvious, who likes to listen to taunts, no one). Your thoughts are again and again taking you to those crossed roads. You are just walking, thinking something, murmuring something, when asked about your murmurs, you just stare and that stare is sometimes frightening for others. You cannot sit, you feel extremely anxious, you just cannot eat properly. You wanna commit suicide but thoughts about your family after you, are not even allowing that. Still you say I am going to commit suicide, you open the door, your family tries to prevent you but your strength is too much that even 2\u20133 people combined cannot stop you (There I realized Mind is very very powerful). You go to terrace and come back after sometime. Nothing inspires you, you don\u2019t feel good in anything and you are uncontrollable, uncomfortable. Sometimes you even try to hurt yourself by taking a stance as if you are running a 100 m race, you run and bang your head with a wall, on top of that you laugh after getting hit. You family members consult a Doctor, the doctor prescribes you some medicine then you just sleep, when you wake up, your family offers you something to eat, your family is terrified about your next step, they just want you to eat and sleep again. You somehow forcefully eat, take medicine, sleep again and the cycle continues. One of your family member is extremely terrified seeing your present situation, stress and anxiety of that family member will cause him\/her a health complexion in future. This is bound to happen. You remember nothing except for the hurting past. You forget your goals, you tend to forget everything except that fucking past. You are sometimes referred to as mental, you are suggested to go to a mental hospital. This doesn\u2019t affect you much as you are in a different world but it certainly lowers the morale of your family members. Your family members keep on changing doctors, you show some improvement every time, but the sudden panic attack destroys everything. Slowly and gradually your family members start losing hope. Your family refrain from going outside, they try to cut themselves from the social world afraid of suggestions and unnecessary questions. Your financial situation, mental condition with physical health everything worsens. The family is broken, everything starts falling apart. Your presence feels nothing to your family members, you cry, your family cries too but secretly. Good doctors say exercising is the only solution to recover completely from depression, but you are not even present in this world, how will you exercise, but you and your family has to make you do it somehow. If you are lucky, your family members\u2019 consistent efforts somehow finds a good Doctor, your treatment changes, you show a positive change. Some stars align and you start improving slowly and gradually. You yourself show some positivity, you yourself try exercising, you yourself are eager to go out of this loop, to stop medicines completely. You are now on the right path. You try making new friends who don\u2019t know much about your past, they try making you cheerful, some of your old friends try to remind you of your past abilities. Now the real recovery starts. You need this much patience and you need to keep even a slightest of the hope to revive a depression patient. It\u2019s really hard, easier said than done, for many it becomes an infinite loop, only a few are able to come out of it, but when they come out of it, it is worth it.   Depression is a disease where a patient suffers unconsciously and his\/her family members suffer consciously. The only thing that is common is suffering.

I didn't realize at any point that I am no longer behaving like a normal human. I used to sleep most of the times, poor appetite and much more. It felt like a slow poison.   I stopped attending my coaching classes, used to give my ID card to my friends so they can help me with attendance. For context, I was in Allen career institute and they have this system of attendance through your ID card. Before entering into your class you need to scan your card for attendance. Otherwise, they send a message to your parents phone number that your child is absent today. If there's no tight security anyone can scan your card and you are free. Your parents won't be able to know about it. So I used to give my card to my best friend initially but after a month she denied to do this. Then, I started giving it to other people and they were okay to do this for me.   I used to wake up around 1pm after sleeping for like 14-16 hours. Then our hostel warden used to drag us for that pathetic lunch. I had lunch without even brushing my teeth. I started hating food and used to throw most of the things from my plate. I was literally living on bread and mayonnaise.   For the whole afternoon and evening, i used to binge watch movies, shows, YouTube and surf internet. It was all mindless scrolling and binging. Needless to say, I used to cry in between as well whenever the thought of not studying comes in my head. I had fear but I only found comfort surfing internet. Slowly that became an escape from my reality.   I had bouts of energy when I used to get up and do all my chores but in no time I crash again. Harder than before. Everything was happening in a loop. I used to lie to my parents about everything. I never got the courage to tell them that  \u201cI want help and I am not doing well\".   I can go long and long talking about my depression days and believe me some days were brutal. Many a times god saved me from near death experiences. I will try to talk about those sometime later, if I am ever be able to gather some courage to talk about that.   I had no idea about what depression is at that time\u2026   \u2018The other thing about depression is it kinda collapses time'. Suddenly you find your whole days blending together to create one endless and suffocating loop.   So, you find yourself trying to remember the things that made you happy.   But, slowly your brain begins to erase every memory that ever brought you joy.   And, eventually, \u2018all you can think about is how life has always been like this way'.

This is because society tells us that we are lacking (too fat, too thin, ugly, short, tall, whatever - we\u2019re not \u201cperfect enough\u201d for society), and we either can\u2019t change the situation because of financial or other reasons, or we won\u2019t because we\u2019re afraid of the change. You live in fear of other people\u2019s judgements. You hate yourself for it, but you can\u2019t help being affected by their stares, comments, whispers and tittering behind hands. You want to slap the crap out of people who quietly pity you or make fun of you, and it happens, no matter what age you are. You\u2019re constantly  tired . Trying to manage a balance is a nightmare, and your emotions wear you out! Then you have the ennui - the lack of emotion. When the ennui hits, you\u2019re desperate to feel  something  - and you\u2019re scared emotion won\u2019t come back. It becomes a cycle of anxiety because your emotions are unbalanced, worried your fears are unfounded and you\u2019re just being stupid, and you can\u2019t sleep when you need to. Your sleep patterns might change. You either suddenly sleep way too much, or you can\u2019t fall asleep, or you keep waking up, which screws your chemistry up anyways. Or, worse, when you do sleep, you keep having nightmares and become  afriad  to sleep (which was part of my issue). Your appetite suffers. You either comfort eat (see: overeat) or get so messed up inside you forget to eat. Yes, you have the physical sensation of hunger, but you ignore it as yet another thing about your body you don\u2019t trust to be truthful. You expect your body to betray you about so much, why\u2019s that any different? Either that or you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll toss your cookies if you put one bite into your gut. Eventually, you have no choice, but then you don\u2019t even have the energy to eat - which makes you sicker. You might cry a LOT. The depression\u2019s bad enough, but the sheer  frustration  of not getting any relief is just unrelenting, and by the time you get to a therapist or someone to help, you\u2019re all torn up mentally. People are full of shit. Seriously. The next time someone tells me \u201cOh, if I do some meditation outside at sunrise and see the beauty of the world around me, I can\u2019t be depressed. You should try it!\u201d The problem is, you\u2019ve already TRIED that, and it didn\u2019t work. And if you had the energy to get up at five in the damned morning to sit there and go OHMMMMMMMMMMMMM, you\u2019d likely not be needing help. The problem is people don\u2019t understand because they\u2019ve never endured it. You become terrified that you\u2019re going to be seen as a non-person, a statistic. \u201cOh, did you hear about Julie?\u201d they might ask (using a random name, don\u2019t worry about that). \u201cShe\u2019s got depression.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d says another. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. She\u2019s not able to trust her own judgement.\u201d \u201cWell, you know how mental health issues are - they\u2019re just messed up somehow.\u201d Yeah - there\u2019s a great thing to hear  from people you trust!!!!  You\u2019re talked about like you\u2019re no longer in the room, or like you\u2019re an invalid, a non-person. You\u2019re defined by your disorder, not your personality. And that\u2019s the loneliest feeling in the world, and it breaks what little trust you have in people. Every betrayal or act like the above completely breaks your willingness to trust in people - which further isolates you. You withdraw further, you don\u2019t go out, you don\u2019t bother doing anything, and you spiral further and further down, and it gets easier and easier to slide down the lower you go. Think of depression as terminal velocity - the further you fall, the more dangerous it gets. Eventually, you stop caring about being alive. It hurts too much, the concept of thinking, trying, the effort\u2026. you just don\u2019t have any more strength to keep fighting. Nobody wants to be around you, because you\u2019re a negative nelly - you\u2019re psychologically just done. You write \u201cthe letter\u201d several times, throwing your beginnings away ten or twenty times because you can\u2019t think of what to say. Eventually, you make the attempt\u2026. and that\u2019s when people realize how badly off you really were. And THEN they care. Depression\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, and it\u2019s NOTHING to joke about. The worst words you can EVER say to someone is kys - \u201ckill yourself\u2019 - because you never know when you\u2019re just given them the push they needed to go over the edge. Do not ever think, until you\u2019ve experienced it yourself, that you can understand the depths in which this goes - you never know how deep the ocean is until you start sinking in it.\n\nTake it from someone who has and lives with depression: Unless you experience it yourself, you can never truly understand.

It\u2019s not something that will go away once you wake.   It seems like the nightmare is here to stay.   You have even lost your tears. Those tears of acid have already broken you.   Get up.   Yes, I am telling you to get up.   Step outside your house. Feel the frosty air on your skin.   Take a long breath and notice the tiny clouds you make when you exhale.   Lie on the grass and admire the glory of the night sky.   Find the moon and the elusive stars that shield the tapestry of black. Let them know every inch of your soul. Believe me, it\u2019s safe in their arms.   Your insecurities. The thoughts that break you. Your pain.   Tell them everything.   Let the stars and the moon bear the weight of your thoughts for a while. You have been carrying them for too long.   When it gets too cold, get inside.   Prepare a cup of warm tea and absorb its warmth.   Take a pen and write down whatever you are feeling right now.   Write the feelings you wanted the world to know, the ones they didn\u2019t want to know.   Keep the words safe. One day, you might help the world with your journey of hope.   When you feel the cold air rattling your bones, get back into the arms of your blanket.   I hope your thoughts get better. As you slowly drift away to sleep, remember to wake up with hope. I have faced loss and immense pain. I know how it feels to be broken.   I have seen hardships up close. I have felt the feeling of loneliness.   But, I stand again \u2014 moving a little bit each day.   The lessons that I have learned help me in my journey.   They remind me that I am a warrior.   I won\u2019t let anything destroy me without a fight. Your life is a world of both good and bad.   Take a moment to slow down and absorb all of it.   Life is not about sitting in a corner and waiting for the storm to pass. Life is about how you learn to dance under the very storm.   It\u2019s not easy but daily efforts add up to better results.   Always remember that the process of healing isn\u2019t a straight path.\n\nDepression.   Depression is pain. The worst kind of suffering.

I surrounded myself with people too.   But, all of these were just layers of masks I was wearing. I used to cut myself. I wished I wouldn\u2019t have to wake up the next morning.

The white ceiling becomes the only view you are going to have in the next few days. Lying horizontally is the only posture you will be in for the next few weeks.   What about the pain ? you ask.  It isn\u2019t there . You see that\u2019s the worst part. You shut down your senses. Pizza tastes like broccoli. Or it doesn\u2019t? You don\u2019t know or maybe because you stopped caring.   You don\u2019t laugh but you don\u2019t cry either. You don\u2019t want to live but death is not what you want. All you need is the emotions that you\u2019ve lost.   A living corpse is what you are.

That is the reason, most people around the afflicted individual will try to give all sorts of  ill advice  like,  \"get over it\"  or \" take a vacation\"  or  \"think positive and shrug off the negativity\"  which is counterproductive, since it makes the afflicted individual feel even more helpless and guilty about him not being able follow their 'advice' The fact is, depression Continue Reading I'll answer your question in the same way as you've asked the question, in 3 parts: Depression is one of disorders which is  very hard to understand , until you yourself suffer from it, or have seen enough people been afflicted with it. That is the reason, most people around the afflicted individual will try to give all sorts of  ill advice  like,  \"get over it\"  or \" take a vacation\"  or  \"think positive and shrug off the negativity\"  which is counterproductive, since it makes the afflicted individual feel even more helpless and guilty about him not being able follow their 'advice' The fact is, depression saps you of all energy, motivation, makes you vulnerable to latch onto negative emotions, makes you see the world in a negative light. So even if you understand that you need to get a move on, and yourself want to get out it, you just can't. It takes guided effort to get out of it. So when you've lost experiencing pleasure from things you once used to be so excited about, you find it an effort to even talk to your loved ones, when you lose interest in most activities you once enjoyed, you either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all, you either feel you have no appetite left or you eat excessively and don't understand why, you know how you feel.  Sickly unpleasant  would be a an understatement. Dealing with depression is tricky. Since it is so poorly understood, and people still view it as something caused by lack of will power, or weakness of being, or as an excuse of an illness, it makes the battle for the person suffering from it, even harder. Because, as if, what depression itself is doing to the physical and mental health of the person, is not enough, he has to deal with unaware, ignorant people around. Acceptance  is key. Most find it extremely difficult to accept the fact that they can be afflicted by depression like anybody else on the planet. Nobody is immune to it. Acknowledgment  of the symptoms and seeking timely help is the next most important thing. Much damage is done in the interval between one being aware of the symptoms and seeking that professional opinion for the first time. A lot of research has shown, early intervention results in lesser relapses, faster recovery, and cutting short the total duration of illness. Choosing the  right psychiatric professional  is the next step. A psychiatric professional with an empathetic approach will come out with a management plan (which might include therapy\/counseling &\/or medication depending upon the severity of the illness) unique to the individual. Lastly, and most importantly, and as a sequential step to the management of the illness, one has to be extremely patient. The symptoms of depression do not emerge out of the blue. There are a lot of factors, like genetic propensity, childhood and adolescence events, parenting, personality, relationships, dietary habits, hormonal disturbances, further life events, which culminate together with that one significant stressor, in surfacing the symptoms of depression. So, if something that takes so many factors to develop, you can't expect it to be resolved in a matter of few days. It takes time. The medication prescribed, to show their optimal effect, take 2-3 weeks at least. Therapy could take even longer. Also patients, invariably, when they start feeling better, stop taking treatment, without the consultant's advise, which only results in incomplete treatment, increased duration of illness and treatment, and possibility of more relapses. To sum it up, awareness, acceptance, acknowledgment and early and continued treatment are essential for a person to successfully come out of depression.\n\nI'll answer your question in the same way as you've asked the question, in 3 parts: Depression is one of disorders which is  very hard to understand , until you yourself suffer from it, or have seen enough people been afflicted with it.

But let's do it.   I remember the day when my father saw me off in the hostel. I was crying. It was so bad that I ran out of breaths and vomited, best known to no one.   I packed my bags and left for home and spent days on of terrace of the house thinking nothing. I didn't appear for two consecutive exams afterward, wondering if I was good enough. For myself.

It was so bad that I ran out of breaths and vomited, best known to no one.   I packed my bags and left for home and spent days on of terrace of the house thinking nothing. I didn't appear for two consecutive exams afterward, wondering if I was good enough. For myself. For my parents.   Life seemed meaningless.   I always wanted to be in love, dreams were not lucid anymore. Worthlessness was so much, I thought I deserved nothing but sadness. I have always been reserved and did not like talking to anyone about my situation. The stigma of appearing weak was so deeply ingrained that I chose to go through it alone.   Never do it. It's not an idea I would sell. Always speak up. You aren't alone. And sharing wouldn't make you weak. If you need to talk. Talk.   Yet I don't follow. I like to take charge of my own things. I don't know why.   Gone were the days of crying.   The real storm started when I actually stopped crying . Days after days I would slog in bed until my head started to spin. I didn't want to get out of bed.   I remember I stopped feeling beautiful too.   I was applying eye-liner for my sister's wedding and my hands were shaking while my negatively influenced mind was beating my self-confidence. It seemed I would be the ugliest one present there. My mother was telling me I was looking good but everything seemed nothing. The January, the beginning of the end started.   I remember I cried on my birthday. My father brought a cake but no one was interested in cutting a cake on my birthday. Ah. Loneliest birthday. Didn't I deserve to be happy?   In the month of May, I would use a blanket and cocoon myself. I remember having panic attacks at night twice in the month of March or April. I remember going lowest and cutting.   I had backlogs and been simultaneously preparing for CAT. I scored as low as 57 percentile and that further strengthened my belief that I was actually good at nothing.   Every third day ,  my father would tell me, \u201cYou don't have to go much further just show me you can graduate\u201d. It hurt me the most.   When your parents stop believing in you, you lose one more wish to keep the battle going on.   I couldn't scold my sister for her mistake in solving the sum. Because hey, I was a failure and I didn't deserve to.   I never asked my parents for any extra penny even though by God's grace my father can afford the bits I want and ex helped me whenever it was needed, but since, I was a failure and didn't deserve luxuries.   I begged and cried to my best man to understand me and not leave me because I wasn't able to take it anymore.   I thought this actually is the meaning of life. I didn't deserve the peace of mind. Your Happiness is in your hands. When you understand this. Nothing matters at all. Nothing.   Yes. Dealing with depression requires Patience and Consistency is the key. It takes a lot of strength to not give up on life. So many times I contemplated jumping in front of the train, how does it feel to give up?   How cutting would heal the chaos in my mind.   I didn't like sleeping all day. But I didn't like getting up as well. Now, I had failed. A lot. Personally. Career-wise. I had contemplated suicide. But I didn't die. I had no one to talk to despite having opened to the only people who I thought would understand. What else can go wrong? I have already hit the lowest. Yet I didn't die.   The medication was the last option I would choose. I was feeling weak already and didn't want medication to stimulate the hormones or my nervous system. For me, mediation seemed a temporary solution.   How did I deal with it?   I stopped going hard on me.   I stopped caring for what others would feel.   I stopped caring for the people around me. I needed to take care of myself first. It's okay to be selfish.   If I am not happy. My negativity would affect my surrounding.   I stopped expecting anyone to understand my situation.   I stopped counting my failures.   I stopped caring about others' happiness. If I am not happy, I can't keep anyone around me happy. So I focused on my happiness. It's shallow but it has worked.   I started maintaining a journal.   Trust me when I read what I have had gone through that time, I don't relate with it. It seems like I am reading someone else's story and it wasn't me.   I started writing things I should be and have been grateful for.   I started reminding myself about the carefree childhood I had. It made me care less about what people would say.   I write short goals and maintain a to-do list.   Most of the parents, would not understand what's wrong with you. But when you give up on life, for a day or two people will mourn and the rest of the life your parents would regret not understanding you.   Having said that, if your social image is more important than your health and well being for them, then it's not worth taking the negative remarks you get when you fail.   Accept the fact that it's okay.   It is okay to fail in exams.   It's okay to fail in love.   It's okay to make mistakes.   It's okay if nobody cares.   Nothing is bigger than your life.   Stand in the balcony and stare at nothingness, if you can't go outside.   You are enough for yourself. Always. You are not a burden. You are a blessing. I started saving money and treating myself with chocolate when I solved a paper. Or scored well in mock.   I became more generous towards people once I started to understand gratitude for what I had.   One thing I never did was close my books. Since childhood, I loved solving puzzles and reasonings, even though it took time, my love for it was immense.   I had not solved a single sum for days, but I made sure every fourth or fifth day, I solved at east one.   Train journeys were my times. I would share my location details with my parents and strictly tell them not to call me until an emergency. That was my \u201cMe\u201d time. I would simply enjoy the winds getting soaked in my skin and feel happy for no reason. Had I given up the day,   I wouldn't have cleared CAT.   I wouldn't have gotten a chance to clear interviews! And boost up my self-confidence.   My parents wouldn't feel proud of me and brag about it to people. I wouldn't have gotten a chance to feel the old school love.   I wouldn't have this journey which I would fall in love with. I know, it is still a long way to go.   I wouldn't know I deserve every happiness and can be happy without any explanation.   I do not have a job. I am stuck in the final semester of my masters and yet I don't know why I am not sad or worried. It's going well. I took so many photos. I wouldn't be able to enjoy this beautiful scenery and feel blessed to live in the village! I wouldn't know how strong as a person, I could become.  Now when the war is over, I now know, come what may, if I could beat that, I would beat anything now. Hopefully.   I am your average girl. Ordinary and simple. No extra demands from life. Every day, I try to improve myself as a human. What do you want to give up?   Your war against your demons you fighting inside or your life?   Why do you want to give up?   It is not the way you finish your war. Always remember you are the most skilled warrior in your life.   For whom do you want to give up on your life?   If it's them, then they don't deserve to be in your life in the first place. If it's for you. You are the most important soul to yourself or   Always put yourself above anyone. Always. It's okay. It's not selfish. It's okay.   You matter to yourself.   Be ready to welcome the spring after the winter.   Giving up isn't the option. Rise back. It's okay to fall. Take care.\n\nOh, I so do not want to go through the memories.   But let's do it.   I remember the day when my father saw me off in the hostel. I was crying.

Mindfulness is a simple but powerful tool that simply requires you to be present in the moment. Use your 5 senses to be present. Look at something around you, notice smells, touch things. Listen to the sounds around you. Treat your difficult feelings with respect. Let them in. Feel them. Remember this is the only way to get better.\n\nThe underlying cause of depression is feelings that have not been worked through. They could date back to early childhood, even infancy.

I want to share a deeply personal story about my mental health journey and how Manastha has been a constant source of support and healing for me.   My first experience with Manastha dates back to 2020, when the world was turned upside down by the pandemic. Like many, I found myself battling anxiety and stress that began affecting my physical health. I knew it was time to reach out for help again.   When I needed therapy recently, my previous therapist wasn\u2019t available due to vacation. Manastha quickly assigned me a new, well-trained psychologist, and what amazed me the most was how effortlessly they passed on my case history. I didn\u2019t have to go through the emotional strain of retelling my story. The transition was smooth, compassionate, and thoughtful. I felt heard, understood, and cared for.   Every experience I\u2019ve had with Manastha has left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and less alone in my journey. And I want to share why Manastha might be the right choice for you too.   Why Manastha Stands Out:   1.  Affordable, Transparent Pricing : No hidden costs, just genuine care.   2.  Immediate Support within 60 Minutes : You can be connected with a therapist in as little as 60 minutes \u2013 because your mental health matters now, not later.   3.  Real, Uninterrupted Sessions : A full 60-minute session means ample time to explore, express, and heal \u2013 unlike some services that cut corners with shorter sessions.   4.  Expert Care  from  AIIMS  &  NIMHANS  Professionals: Manastha offers access to some of the most respected mental health experts in the country, ensuring you receive top-notch support.   5.  Professional  and  Compassionate Team : They don\u2019t just offer therapy; they build relationships. The extra sessions and extended validity they offered me when I needed it most were gestures of genuine kindness.   6.  Trusted by Global Leaders : There\u2019s a reason why top companies like  SAMSUNG ,  HCL ,  WIPRO ,  AMITY ,  TITAN , etc trust Manastha for their Employee Assistance Programs. Manastha\u2019s reputation for professionalism and client satisfaction is unmatched.   A few months ago, I decided to return to therapy, and I was amazed when they reconnected me with my previous therapist. It felt like reconnecting with an old friend who already knew my journey and was ready to help me continue it.   Manastha also have psychiatric services with experts from AIIMS and NIMHANS, and I\u2019m currently benefiting from that as well. Their commitment to comprehensive mental health care is truly remarkable.   If you\u2019ve been struggling silently, please know that help is just one step away. I\u2019m here to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to reach out.   We deserve healing. We deserve support. And we deserve to feel whole again.\n\nMANASTHA ONLINE COUNSELING: A Journey to Healing and Self-Discovery   Hello everyone,   I\u2019m  Surbhi , originally from India but currently living in Sweden.

Which is as follows.   1) Medicine - Ayurvedic medicine is completely natural and has no side effects. You can use Ashwagandha tablet or powder. Ashwagandha protects the neurons of your brain from getting damaged.   You can consume Ashwagandha powder in the amount of 3 grams twice a day with milk.   Along with this, you can consume 250 mg of Moti Pishti twice a day with milk. You can use it for 4-6 months. It helps in relieving your stress.   2) Tratak - In this you have to light a candle and look at it. It is more beneficial to do it in the morning. It stimulates your glands, which activates the neurotransmitters of your brain and it helps in balancing the serotonin levels, which makes the brain work properly.   3) Yoga and Meditation - You can learn this from a trained person.

There is no known physical cause for depression because depression is a thought disorder.   You manage depression by managing your thoughts. You have to break the obsessive rumination habit. The thought loop is the real problem. These obsessive thoughts affect your physical health. Sleep is disrupted, appetite is disrupted sensitivity to pain is greatly increased and all these things make you feel like shit and that physical feeling just reinforces the thought loop.   As a person who believed the chemical imbalance lie and was on multiple mood altering drugs for the better part of 30 years, I can tell you that drugs are the least effective way to manage depression.   These drugs over the long term just make you numb. Sure you don't feel depressed but you don't feel anything either.   Like most things in life you actually have to do something to see results. Taking a pill or pills every day isn\u2019t the answer.   You have to get out of your head and into your body no matter how shitty or tired you feel. You are not your thoughts is the single most important lesson to learn. A mindfulness practice coupled with cognitive behavioral therapy will help you break the thought loop.   Diet and exercise are the next things. Clean up your diet and stop eating shit food and you will start to feel better. Build up to a moderate daily exercise regimen that includes resistance and cardio at least 3 days a week and you have all the pieces to manage depression and break the thought loop.\n\nDepression is a thought disorder.

Environmental factors:  Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression. From therapy and\/or medication to different alternative\/natural remedies including healthy lifestyle changes, there are many different treatment options available.   Of course, just as no two people are affected by depression in exactly the same way, neither is there a \u201cone size fits all\u201d treatment to overcome depression. What works for one person might not work for another. By becoming as informed as possible, though, you can find the treatments that can help you overcome depression, feel happy and hopeful again, and reclaim your life.   If you have depression,  other than medication and therapy , there are things you can do to help yourself, such as getting more physical activity, walking, making the environment more pleasant, exercising, getting enough sleep, practicing mindfulness, taking up a new hobby, talking to someone, listening to nature, practicing gratitude, eating healthy, and finally enjoying good quality time with the family.

Their are many factors that cause it. If it stems from childhood to the adult stage, depression can be overwhelming. I am not a psychologist but I have experienced it. It takes time to overcome it and starting to feel that you are a valuable person in society. Deep depression does require intervention with a licensed Psychologist or therapist, also licensed. There are all kinds of medication to help treat it as well and that has to be prescribed by an MD or Psychiatrist. Through a Psychologist or a therapist, they can provide help in one on one counseling or group therapy. You are not crazy, just at point in your life where you may need help. That is determined by you and counseling. Depression may lead to street drugs and other undesirable behavior. It most likely took you a long time to get in to a depression and may time some time to get out of it. Honestly, we are all human and we are allowed to get depressed at times when things don\u2019t go right. Sometimes, we just feel down and berate ourselves depending upon the circumstance. The idea is to get out of it as quick as you can, yourself. Sometimes, though, it may require outside help. Long term depression is much harder to get out of because it can be a major life change. You need a purpose in your life and above all, have faith in God. I mention God, because he is the ultimate power.   I brought up earlier, how I was raised. You can find me on my bio and have a rather lengthily discussion of my life and how I was brought up. I suffered through hell and torment and you can read it. Honestly, my life is now changing and it has taken me 70 years to do so. Now, I am finding a lot more peace in my life. What I am saying to you not to wait that long. I don\u2019t know how old you are but I bet you are younger than I am. There is help and the sooner you find it, the better off you will be. There is hope and you will find it as well. Don\u2019t succumb yourself and fall into the ashes. Rise up, and look at life in a different way, being more positive. Don\u2019t let depression take hold of your body and mind. There is a rainbow over the horizon. You can do it, I know you can. If you don\u2019t have faith, seek God. If you have faith, seek his will.\n\nThere are many things that can cause depression.

But something, I\u2019m not sure what specifically, breaks in the brain, making it uncapable of doing so.   There is generally no one specific thing that leads to it though genetics may play a huge role in the susceptability to contract it. It is generally \u201cactivated\u201d after the patient has experiences extreem degrees of stress for extended amounts of time. That said, it can be triggered by other conditions, namely PTSD, Post Partum Depression or Bipolar disorder just to name a few.   Overcoming it depends on something known as the 5 pillars that tend to change names depending on who you ask, but they can be summed as the following: Nutrition  - being essential for those molecules to be produced in the first place. Vitamins, minerals & electrolytes, balanced blood ph, hydration, and gut flora balance are important for any healthy individual. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that deficiencies of these kind may result in symptoms generally associated with depression. Overeating, fatigue, random pains, impulsive behaviour and cognitive impairment to name afew. Exercise  - The brain, like the body follows Lamarkism very closely, the less you use something, the more likely you are to lose it. Weather it be to some other desease such as cancer, or simple destruction by the muscle proteins in your body. Exercising is a good way of letting your brain release endorphines, the hormones that make you feel good after a good workout session. There is more to this, but for simplicities sake, let\u2019s just say there is a lot of research material out there if you\u2019re interested. Relaxing  - Arguably the most underated of the list. When you are stressed, your body secretes an hormone called cortizol, that basicly puts your body on overdrive. Allowing you to complete your task till the end. But it is known to cause damage during prolonged exposure as it inhibits your body from rebuilding itself. It\u2019s like running a motor at full rotations for a whole day. It\u2019s going to break down way sooner than you anticipate. As if you needed any more reason for a good nights sleep. Social Support  - Humans are by default social creatures, and even the most introverted of us need some human interaction from time to time. Though there may be exceptions, people need eachother. ( It\u2019s just like \u201cConway's Game of Life\u201d ) . Most isolated organisms fail in the longevivity test when they are isolated. That doesn\u2019t mean though one should simply mindlessly mingle. Meaningful connections are more valuable that having over a thousand friends who you rarely talk with. Thus, in the words of William Gibson popularly associated with Sigmund Freud: \u201c Before diagnosing yourself with depression, make sure you aren\u2019t just around sh*tty people\u201d ( or something equating to that saying ). Mental Stimulation  - This one in likely the most broad, yet most natural to define. It is the sense of progress and purpose of one\u2019s life. Weather it be intellectual endeavors ( learning new things, new skills, Entertainment media, or new experiences ), spiritual ( Religious, emotional wellbeing, balance in one\u2019s life. Or even taking that much needed piss. It is in essence what one would call  Self - Actualisation . Like cancer, it is a disease that results from the bodies inability to auto-regulate. And like any desease, it can\u2019t simply be willed away nor \u201ccured\u201d by a placebo. Common tratments include anti-depressants like MAOI\u2019s and SRI\u2019s that slow down the rate at witch the body consumes brain hormones, making it more readily available.   As a bonus, you may notice that people with disorders associated with depression when are excited or happy about something, know that a really bad dread is about to hit soon after. Sounds a lot like finishing that cup of coffee doesn\u2019t it?\n\nDepression  is the neurological condition where essential hormones are depleted by the body faster than they can be produced, causing an deficit in their availability.

Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.   Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression.

After they married, their depression continued throughout their marriage to their deaths. My mother committed suicide at about age 51 years. I grew with depression and many of my family members suffer from it. From about age 14 my life long learning has been about how to manage depression. (I myself spent two weeks in hospital suffering from severe depression at one point) I believe I have mastered the cure. It has to do with your feelings of sadness. And the clue is that you don't know where they come from. That's because its a habit or pattern that your brain falls into. Your brain has 'neural pathways' that  connect certain thoughts, feelings and behaviours which become set routines that the brain adopts, simply by habit. The pathway may have been started in childhood, even by observing a parent when you were a toddler.  Every time you repeat that behaviour, it becomes more concrete and more likely that you will repeat it again. Other people may find that the depression starts from trauma, but the recurring patterns of thinking still apply.    This process is aligned to depression that I encountered, growing up with depressed parents, though I did suffer some abuse as a child. The first step to healing, I believe is to recognise your feelings of sadness are just feelings. Superficial feelings that have no actual meaning. The second step is to begin to break the pattern. It actually takes a lot of hard work and persistence, but is completely do-able. You have to believe you can be well, and that this will work. It's important to hold on with strength to a belief that you can change.    To break the habit you can do anything you choose, just don't dwell on the sadness. Depending on what you have energy for, do something that overrides the feelings. Watch a funny movie. Listen to upbeat radio. I'm a big fan of self-hypnosis and I download self-hypnosis audios to play to my brain when it has nothing else better to do that resort to sadness. This is particularly useful at night as your depression may be keeping you awake at night, and you want to interfere with your sleep as little as possible and play something gentle to occupy your brain, with the lights off. There's a huge amount of useful science about the relationship with depression and lack of sleep.    The depression (stress hormones; cortisol and adrenaline) wake you up at night and keep you awake. The poor sleep and lack of REM sleep impacts your thinking during the day and you aren't able to activate your brain normally. This is why ensuring you get enough good sleep is part of the healing process.    Once you start to learn how to bypass your sad feelings you can replace one activity with another more healthy one. You can do it in stages. Replace TV with ringing a friend. Then you might introduce a yoga class. You might introduce walking. Then you might increase your activities to a sport. And a regular social outing, like some kind of a club. It's important to use habit to gradually change your lifestyle and exchange 'depression' with other uplifting things. Ensure you spend time with people who don't get depressed. Its important to learn to copy their actions instead of the behaviours of people who get depressed. You need to learn it right down to a cellular level. It has to a 'feeling' learning not a 'thinking' learning. (For more information about this read Virginia Satir and her books like; \"People making\")   For this reason, talking about your sad feelings won't help. There's science to show the more you talk about why you feel sad, or how many times you feel sad, the more those feelings are confirmed and cemented into your psyche.    Meditation teaches you how to observe a thought (or in this case a feeling) and then let it pass. The trick is to let it pass and replace it with some other thought or emotion. Do this 'replacement' often enough and it becomes habit.   What is written above sums up a lifetime of learning. I'm over 50 now, but I've read many, many books, listened to many, many advisers, studied psychology, paid for services, (including psychologists.)  been on retreats, been on medication and in hospital. I'm in very good health and don't have any depression. I do get stressed, upset and angry from time to time, but these are normal feelings which are caused by external events and I process them and they pass.   Other things that have helped me are; Learning to really LOVE yourself (not as easy as it sounds) inner child therapy (you can find out more if it interests you) and NLP.   One more thing (this was told to me by an elderly psychologist) Alcohol is a depressant. Don't use it to relieve sad feelings. It interferes with your REM sleep - just like many other drugs, and so these are not useful in your recovery. Ensure that you don't use drugs or alcohol to create another negative habit. (I recommend not using them at all) In saying that, social activities are very important. If having a beer or wine etc, in a social setting gives you a lift every week or every so often, then that is fine. Just be wary of alcohol and drugs. They can so often lead to more pain, if you don't resolve to investigate some of those inner child  fears and negative thoughts.

Additionally, to anyone who thinks that is cheering someone up who is suffering from depression, there is an added bonus. You have now added guilt and pressure on top of debilitating depression. Now, they haven\u2019t tried hard enough or worked long enough or jumped high enough to make their depression stop. Now, somehow they are inadequate. Believe me, the depressed mind goes there.   Let me address that when you are depressed it actually alters your cognitive ability to process triggers, emotion, energy, or even normal everyday thought. When you are depressed, you DON\u2019T CARE about being happy because the darkness is so heavy, you have begun to suffocate beneath it. To simply \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d IS NOT POSSIBLE.   A depressed person doesn\u2019t need anything other than an, \u201cI understand\u201d and hugs. They need someone to be there and if you truly don\u2019t understand but you love the person who is suffering, please don\u2019t say a word other than, \u201cI love you.\u201d   Now, that being said, if you are suffering from depression for two weeks or more, you should go see a doctor because you could be clinically depressed. That can be very dangerous. Remember your cognitive ability to reason is altered and things that never made sense ...\n\nAs wonderful as some of these answers have been, I have to disagree with simply putting forth effort or the will and you will therefore be cured of your depression. As great as that sounds on paper, it isn\u2019t the case. You are not in control of a chemical imbalance that is possibly taking place within your brain. Depression is a disease just like any other illness, only people who do not understand Continue Reading\n\nThere are several ways to overcome severe depression without medication or therapy.

Their mind is in turmoil because they are trying to use the same brain that got them into this crisis in the first place to get them out of it. They are caught in a vicious downward spiral in which they see no hope.   So, how exactly would a seriously depressed person take care of their own emotional well being when they have lost all the will and the motivation to do so? Depression takes away the very tools required to dig someone out of the hole they find themselves in.   Now we move on to the physical aspect.   One of the overwhelming symptoms of severe depression is fatigue and tiredness. So again, how does one motivate themselves to take care of themselves physically when every atom of their body is fatigued beyond belief? I have met many many people with severe depression that have had to crawl to get to the toilet such is the extent of their exhaustion.   Therapy and medication can alleviate a lot of the more distressing symptoms of depression. Is it the complete answer and does it work for everyone?  Nothing  is the complete answer and  nothing  works for everyone but it sure beats doing DIY with your own mental health.\n\nI can understand from the point of view of someone that has never suffered serious depression that what you have suggested  can seem  like a good idea.

Here are some things that I believe would help you. Bibliotherapy  or  reading therapy has recently been proven as a great treatment for depression. I'm not sure if it completely cures you, but it does help to a great extent for sure.  Feeling Good- The New Mood Therapy by David Burns  is a great self-help book that you can read. It's an amazing tool that helps you to understand depression and teaches you on how to restructure your thoughts. 2.  Mindfulness:  You must know about this wonderful technique that helps you pay attention to your thought patterns, and teaches you to recognize them without judging them as good or bad. You can easily learn about it on YouTube, or through various self-help\/spiritual books. Practising it(or any form of meditation for that matter) regularly helps a great deal.   3.  Read and Research:  Awareness is the key. You must be aware about depression to be able to handle it. You must read about it, there are plenty of useful newsletters out there(Like psychology today) There are a lot of YouTube channels to help you cope with mental illnesses, Julia Cristina is one YouTuber I know. You can follow them regularly.   4.  Learn:  The most widely used techniques of treatment are cognitive  behavioral therapy , or  acceptance commitment therapy.  If you learn about the basics of these (which again, can be done over the web or through books) it would help you a great deal, a you would be able to regulate your thoughts and emotions, at least to an extent.   5.  Journaling:  This is another powerful tool. Writing regularly helps a lot with depression. If you don't feel like maintaining a diary, there's an online mental health community called  The Mighty  where people come together and share how and what they feel.   6.  Applications:  Thanks to the smartphones, everything is handy. There are a lot of applications (a lot of which are free)and are beneficial for mental health like  DepressionCBT Self-help Guide, Operation Reach Out, Mood Kit  etc. Utilise them.   7 . Exercise:  You must exercise regularly, whatever you like, go for walks, spend time cycling, or any physical activity that you enjoy. (though it can be hard, but definitely worth it.) It changes the chemical reactions going inside the body, making you feel good almost instantly.   Although all this is certainly not a substitute of professional therapy or medication, it does work wonders.   Get well soon :)\n\nHi. Here are some things that I believe would help you.

Today, I will discuss one aspect, that is boosting your energy, igniting the fire inside you.   The best way to do that is engage in physical workout, exercising, Yoga (does wonders), running, long brisk walks, gymming, swimming, playing sports and dancing.   Initially you wouldn't find interest or motivation, but just commit yourself, slowly your body will feel energetic, and motivated to do more, to improve, to live life.   Second thing is producing energy in your mind, that can be done by reading anything which interests you, playing some challenging games like chess, scrabble, doing activities or playing quizzes or other such mental games.   Assigning yourself challenging tasks, or goals, where you have to use your mind and stay engaged. Like learning new things like driving, swimming, a language, anything which fascinates you would also help you in Improving your life as a whole.   One point I always add and is the most important is expression, expression kills depression, express yourself through speaking, talking to someone, self talk, talk to God, writing, dancing, screaming when alone, singing loud.\n\nHave you seen an electrical equipment or a toy which runs on battery?

I tried things -when I felt a little energetic- which made me feel good when I was depressed. Though they make you feel good for a couple of hours but it's all worth it when you are in such a mess.    At first when it started, I wasn't able to control my thoughts. I was going back in the past. I was breaking down at every moment. I used to break down while taking a shower. I used to break down while eating my lunch or dinner. I used to break down as soon as I used to wake up in the morning. I lost interest in everything that I once used to do. I was not able to focus on my job.    Here is what I suggest a person should do to beat depression and gain themselves back:   Do what you couldn't do until now. Do what you have always dreamed of doing. Do that you could not when you held yourself back due to some absurd reasons.    I can tell you what I did:  I survived on instant gratification . Every day did something which made me felt good.  I read. Read and read. I read articles, novels, stories. They helped my mind to keep away the negative thoughts. I read very slowly. I used to imagine every character, situation, dialogue. It was like I'm directing a movie and I'm making it good. I was imagining the book as I read it. It made me happy at least for a while. So, Read. I cooked. Not the recipes that I knew. New Recipes. New Stuff. And it was good. My friends ate it and they complimented me. They went mad. They wanted more of it. And often. This made me feel good. Always. I danced. I just passed out of college two years back. I should admit that I was academically more inclined and did not do too much fun stuff which other people do in their college. When I went to the office new year party, I danced like Hell. Everybody was like....looking. When it ended, everybody said they are willing to learn dance from me. I danced so well. Even my friends from college said that they never knew I dance so well. Frankly, I never knew that too. I started writing a blog. A personal blog, kind of like a diary. I was writing everything that I used to feel. Every thing that I intend to do in future. It was like talking to someone. Telling them what it is all that you feel. And trust me, it feels good to write your thoughts. Take them out. I learnt Photography. I took some tutorials on the internet to learn photography. And it was one of the things that I always wanted to learn about. I watched movies. The ones which are really good but I never saw them. It felt amazing to see some good movies. I talked to my close friends often. I have three close friends. Very close friends. Just like my family. They know everything. They know my passwords too. I changed my hair style often during this period. I used to see a new \"me\" in the mirror and it gave a feeling that everything will be alright. I changed my wardrobe. I used to wear dark and professional colors. Grey, Brown and stuff like that. When you're depressed, these colors make you more depressed. I changed my entire wardrobe. I went for white shirts. Colorful T-shirts. Yellow, Turquoise Blue, Green. I changed it all entirely. And trust me, it breathes new life in you. You will feel good. I traveled to a few places where I felt peace. The air was fresh. Water was cold. Music was refreshing. I met myself. I have currently quit my job. My job was another reason why I was depressed. It was a depressing job. I did not like it at all. I'm single and currently living off my savings. I don't know what I will do. I have applied for few job offers. Currently, I'm studying Psychology. A field I always wanted to know more about. I am also looking for somebody to teach me piano. What I will suggest is: Go out there. Do anything, anything however weird that might be for other people, do it for yourself. If you want to dance in the street, do it. If you want to have sex, do it. If you want to travel, do it.    Don't wait for things to get normal. Don't wait for you to get out of depression. Do things and they will take you out of your depression.    I still sometimes have terrible mood swings especially when I wake up after a night's sleep or a day's nap. I still sometimes cry violently when I am unable to control my self. But I fight. I fight to keep those filthy thoughts away from my mind which I know would suck my energy.    You would need to keep a pinch of hope with you.    I hope that if you are dealing with depression, you kill it and you win.\n\nI'm a 24 year old Indian.

And I could sleep until dawn!   Getting rid of the cocks in your life is of the utmost importance to sleeping well, diminishing the feelings of depression. If you\u2019re not healthy \u2014 eat your fresh fruits, nuts, and veggies, and exercise as much as you\u2019re able.   If your house is a mess and making you sick \u2014 clean it or move. (Black mold is rather great at causing depression in some form or another.)   If your relationships are in shambles \u2014 communicate with people to repair them, reconnect with family or old friends, or go make better relationships.   Go be with people that care about your well-being.   Do your best to not invite more stress into your life.   Pay your bills, practice good hygiene, brush your teeth, take care of infections, fungal growths, yada-yada. And don\u2019t quit your job in a manic moment\u2026   Keep breathing, and do whatever you can to take care yourself. Those days when you feel worthless and can\u2019t move \u2014 take a shower, go sit in the sun, watch the birds, play some music, smile at yourself in the mirror, look at videos of laughing babies and cute kittens for a while.   .   Remember that nobody gets stuck permanently in depression. I know it feels that way sometimes\u2026believe me, after several years of fighting with it, I  know  that feeling. It can friggin\u2019 snowball into a soul-crushing nightmare.   But I can\u2019t think of a single example where as long as the person kept breathing, it didn\u2019t go away. Snowballs can be devastating, but they evaporate in the spring.   Lots of us are living in some stressful times right now with the environment and global economies not working out for a lot of us \u2014 modern technology has made no room for impoverished or middle-class artists.

This allowed me to focus on my actions that the ideal me would make. I cleaned up all all neglect  \u2014 I took care of my health and put myself first. I mended my relationship with my family and apologized to those I had hurt from past actions. I took responsibility for my situation and made sure I kept my word moving forward. These things opened up a whole new world for me. I had hit rock bottom and finally said \u201cI\u2019ve had it!\u201d. I made the decision to build my new foundation on the rock. Today I am living my dream as a serial entrepreneur, I am in a loving relationship, and I am close to my family.   I wish you luck my friend.   Have faith!\n\nYes it is possible.   I was depressed for over 20+ years because I grew up in a broken home which affected me growing up. I overcame my depression between 2017\u20132020 while I did my MBA in the USA.   For context, I did work with a therapist and took some medication for a while but I stopped my medication and only worked with a therapist for a short period because I did my MBA in the USA.   That being said, here is what helped me overcome my depression: I learned to forgive  \u2014 I forgave myself after many years of self-inflicted negativity. I was overly hard on myself whenever I\u2019d mess up.

I knew I needed help and I knew it, I knew too that i was very afraid to do it alone. In case something happened to me while I was not myself. I was in such a state of pain, both physical and mental pain I did not have words to explain it, but it was there. Very real, very scarey and very debilitating. After awhile I was numb with it, flowing thru the motions but still drowning in my sorrows each and every day. It was dark and I was lost. Without my Creator God, my loving and supportive family AND my professional doctors I would not have made it. In time, the healing process fully began. The doctor starts with the underlined reason for my depression and addressing and working through the reasons, then developing my path to healing. The steps I had to take and the barriers I had to face in order to get better. However, following and implementing that plan was much more difficult. Almost unbearable. But it was possible and that's all I needed to know. I was worth it. I had people who cared and I had the courage but finding the strength was even harder. So if your loved one is hurting deep inside and you feel hopeless in helping them reach out to them first and ASK them if you can make the call to get them the help they need. If they agree, go call immediately. If they say no or hesitate, and ask what happens if you make the call anyway. It is because you love them and need them to get well and not suffer any longer. Then you both can decide the best route to take. We inside are screaming thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for recognizing my pain and anguish. And Thank you for helping me, help myself.   It hits home when real love comes calling. They or we know when it is time to get the help we so desperately need but can't voice. Be my voice if I need it. It's like water we all must have it in order to survive. Be the shoulder holding them up until they can walk better again. You won't regret it.\n\nI wouldn't think one could do it if the depression is that grand. Because to face and acknowledge that without professional help or guidance would be for me, impossible.

It is always a good idea to be in a social loop to the best possible extent. Even under normal circumstances, many people feel better after a cry or talking to someone else about their problems. Hence it is definitely therapeutic to talk about thoughts and feelings. If you can\u2019t find the right person talking to a therapist or counsellor definitely works.   Don\u2019t be afraid of facing your real thoughts and feelings. People who care will understand. Even if you don\u2019t feel understood completely it will be a relief.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to do so.   Depression is characterised by an urge to be left alone.

How do you feel?   In depression you can feel tired constantly, even exhausted most of the time, even when you don\u2019t put in much effort   You can feel hopeless and even fall into feeling despair at your life and your situation, there seems no way out for you, nothing to look forward to   Restlessness is a sign of depression, where you can\u2019t sit still, you can also feel irritated, even agitated, like you are spoiling for a fight   Feelings of resentment, bitterness and anger at your situation and towards others can be common too   Another common feeling in depression is to feel \u2018zoned out\u2019 or \u2018out of it\u2019 often   3. What is your daily mood like?   Is your mood mostly; low, flat, dis-interested, apathetic and are you only focused on yourself?   Your moods might be all over the place and it seems very confusing to you   You can feel okay one minute, angry at something minor the next, then sad and weepy, then flat and disinterested shortly after   Then your mood might be normal and you wonder what all the fuss was about   Waves of a deep sadness can come over you in depression, where you want to cry openly, but you have to hide it   If someone else tries to tell you about their life, in general conversation, your mood can be; cold, uncaring and you can be very critical of them in your head   4. Are you behaving differently?   Are you withdrawing and isolating yourself from the world more and more?   Do you spend an increasing amount of time on your own, away from everyone, even people you live with?   Even around people you like, are you closing down, hiding within yourself and staying overly quiet more often than not?   This is not a peaceful, calm type of quiet, like you feel relaxed inside yourself, but a dull uncomfortable quiet, where you hope no one talks to you because you have no idea how to explain what\u2019s going on inside you   To stay isolated and on your own, you might make excuses to people why you can\u2019t go out, that are just not true, but you just don\u2019t care   But you could also be the opposite, where you are acting out around others in unusual or odd ways   Are you behaving in loud, disruptive and even obnoxious ways nowadays?   5. How much energy do you have?   Do you feel worn out often, like you are running on empty for no reason?   You might feel listless, weak or even exhausted often, even when you are putting in little effort to do anything   Having no energy can make you desperately want to relax to try and recharge for long periods, say on weekends, but no matter how much time you spend doing nothing, you can still feel exhausted   As well as having little or no physical energy, you can have next to no mental energy too   When you try to focus, think, make decisions and do your work, it can feel mentally tiring and exhausting   6. Are you sleeping poorly?   This seems to be more common than not; do you feel drowsy during the day and wide awake when it\u2019s time for bed?   Your body\u2019s time clock can seem to be all over the place in depression   Do you toss and turn for hours at night, with racing thoughts that just won\u2019t slow down?   By the time you do get to sleep, you might only end up sleeping for 2 or 3 hours before you have to get up   Maybe you have no problem falling asleep at night, but you wake up in darkness most of the time for no reason and you feel wide awake almost instantly   In other words, you struggle to stay asleep, either way, a lack of sleep sees you yawning and feeling over tired during the day   One other type of sleep problem in depression is where you can sleep for a long time, like 10 to 12 hours, yet you still feel over tired and drowsy when you get up   It hasn\u2019t refreshed you in any way   7. How motivated do you feel?   In depression, you can be so unmotivated often, that people accuse you of being lazy, but that is far from the truth   You can have no drive or enthusiasm, even for doing things you would always enjoy previously   Even when vitally important things need to get done, it can be an absolute struggle to get up and get going and take even the first step   You just seem to feel unmotivated about getting anything done and you don\u2019t care about the consequences   Everyday movements seem to be a struggle, like you are pushing against a huge resistance   Just getting off the couch and taking your first steps towards doing something can be a real struggle   People describe it like having to push through quicksand or a thick treacle   How did you go with these signs of depression? If you have even just one or two of them, it\u2019s wise to see your doctor or qualified health professional and tell them what you are dealing with   You could even write down what applies to you from above and show your qualified health professional   There is no shame in asking for help, we all need help in our lives, even the people around you who you think are bulletproof need help at times, they just won\u2019t admit it to anyone   You are not alone and there are plenty of treatment options for you   Your chances of recovery are also very good, good luck.

They quit calling friends, decreased communication with neighbors and service people. Gradually alone until the end. They begin to become clumsy, breaking items, stumbling, and having accidents. Their mind is too focused on their depressive state. Their home gradually becomes more cluttered and dirty, repairs are ignored. Mail remains unopened inattentive to their environment. Lack of \u2018being present\u2019. You will notice that their body is with you but emotionally and mentally they aren\u2019t engaged. They begin giving things away, nothing has sentimental value anymore. They become confused, forgetful, and apathetic towards both mundane and special events, even their favorite friends. Their speech pattern changes, mumbling, monotone, and barely audible. There is a noticeable lack of humor, their mouth takes a downturned expression. There is a vacant sadness in their eyes. Expression is one of despair. They begin talking about famous suicide victims while their interest towards the topic increases. They express acceptance or approval of suicide. Their vocabulary leads towards, or hinting at, the statement, \u2018\u2019There is no hope or future\u2019\u2019. They express an apathetic attitude towards everyone and everything. They lose the spark and liveliness from their eyes. They gradually develop a dull, lifeless look. The frequency of their smiles gradually decreases until there is a frozen, blank expression on their face of sadness. Their health problems increase and they don\u2019t seek answers or want to talk about it. They stop exercising and sleep more. The extremely depressed won\u2019t seek counseling but exhibit a \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019 persona, trying to fool everyone that they are GREAT, until the body is found.

I noticed that David wasn\u2019t engaged in the assignment he was supposed to be working on. I tried to go over an algebra problem with him. I barely understood what he was saying. When I questioned David if he understood what the professor was writing on the board, he didn\u2019t clarify.   Since I couldn\u2019t get David to focus, I decided to ask him if he was having a hard time keeping up with the class.   David says, \u201cNo Ms. Gonzalez, I haven\u2019t slept for three days.\u201d I asked him \u2018why\u2019 and he opened up about his family life. He said, \u201cMy mom left us (meaning his dad, and two siblings) but she keeps telling us she\u2019s coming back. She left my dad for another man and I know she\u2019s doing drugs. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll show up any day, she did promise to come back. I can\u2019t concentrate in my classes plus I\u2019m always sleepy.\u201d   I then ask David if he has any hobbies. Amazingly, he tells me that he likes to write. I get excited for him since I love writing myself.   Then I proceeded to tell David to write when he can\u2019t stop worrying about his mom coming back or whatever else bothers him. I told David that it\u2019s beyond his control what his mom is doing. I also told him a little about myself and how I used to cope whenever there was some type of hardship in my family while growing up.   Forget about Algebra at that moment!   I wanted to see David\u2019s face (he always looked down) and said, \u201cPlease pull your hair to the side so I can see your full face.\u201d David was a nice looking young man. I then said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hide your face, you are a nice looking young man. Now, please promise me that from now on whenever you feel depress, write about anything that comes to mind.\u201d   You might ask why I don\u2019t send these type of students to the counselor but the answer is that they simply won\u2019t open up. At least, not in this case.   I\u2019ve written about other students that face hardship and don\u2019t know how to cope. I am happy to say that these students do open up to me because they sense that I do care and also give them hope. In fact, most teachers do.   After I was wrapping it up to leave the classroom, the algebra teacher asked me if David did okay.   I told him, \u201cWell, David has family problems and hasn\u2019t slept in three days, he is very worried about his mother coming back home.\u201d He replied, \u201cI wonder why he never mentioned that to me.\u201d   This student was going through deep depression. The signs were there: not focused, not talking to anyone, no hope, almost broke down crying, no sleep, etc. Why do I know the signs, I\u2019ve gone through depression at that age myself.   Hope David\u2019s life improves and that he gets proper treatment for his depression.   Best wishes to all.\n\nI was sent to a math class to tutor a high school student.

Well, she hit the jackpot with that dialogue, didn\u2019t she?   * Depression. has. literally. affected. every. fucking. area. of. my. life. *   From academics to friends to family to sleep to health.   Seriously, your mind can be your own worst enemy.   For the past two years, my life has been deteriorating. The worst part about it is that I am 21 years old. Most of the people around my age are having a good time with their life. And I'm 21 and I was fucking depressed for a large portion of my college life, which is a period supposed to be filled with enjoyment cuz these years won\u2019t come back.   But then you know, there isn\u2019t an age for depression. It can happen at any moment in your life, but it's your choice to fight it though. But we all are tired of fighting every day, aren\u2019t we?   This is how it felt like for a long time, Unable to enjoy anything I loved watching movies, socializing, and going out. It all just seems meaningless after a while. No proper sleep I would take 2 hours just to fall asleep  only to not feel like waking up the next day . Messed up diet I would mostly eat junk food and items that would fulfill my dopamine urges. Unable to focus on anything for a long time In the middle of lectures, my mind would divert  and I would be thinking about something else  entirely. Increased Sexual urges Again to fulfill my dopamine urges I started indulging  in a lot of pornography, which is unhealthy. I\u2019m not ashamed  honestly. Entering a random train of thought at any given point in time I would be walking back from the cafeteria to my hostel and I  would find myself spending an extra 30 minutes walking just  to think about something useless. Making extreme choices I would make choices in the binary sense, either all in or all out. I wouldn\u2019t take small steps toward the same goal. Smoking All the mess that my brain and I had made  of itself resorted to smoking now and then,  just to feel peaceful. Lack of clarity I was very confused most of the time about  what particular action to take moving forward.  Being confused can mess things up. Overthinking The art of creating problems that don\u2019t even  fucking exist. No motivation to move forward Half the time you\u2019re so consumed fighting  your thoughts, that you don\u2019t have the mindset to progress. Misunderstandings Most of my friends(and other people)  would misinterpret my isolation\/silence \/ignorance for me having an attitude or being selfish. Guilt I would feel shitty about who I am and why am I like this. I felt guilty about  being such a shitty son to my parents. Very negative thoughts Even when I made the slightest effort towards doing something meaningful, my brain would  flood with thoughts about me being a big failure. You just don\u2019t feel like existing, because all you feel is lifeless . Yeah, that's about it.   Many of these points are interconnected.   That is what is what depression is for me.   We all have a new journey, and you have no idea what life has in store for you. So keep going!   Hope you liked my answer.   Stay Happy \ud83d\udc95\n\nDo you know who she is?

Small anxieties may culminate into depression if there is no vent available .Infact a very depressed person might not be found regularly as he\/she starts avoiding public appearances .But the basic signs start developing once a person is hit by anything abnormal .Just keep a tap of the deviation from normal behaviour of person .   Usually children and adolescents show signs by performing badly in their schools ,reamaining isolated ,no physical activity .   College teens have now started expressing their anxiety by social media ,whatsapp status (frequently changing ) ,alcohol ,smoking ,parties ,songs may be fast or may be very sad ones .   Mid aged people start eating more , avoid talking to family ,avoid gatherings ,unusual routine ,alcohol ,smoking .   Senior citizens start creating fuss about small things as they want to seek attention of their family ,chose to remain away from home ,try to make new friends of their age ,some of them even try to learn technology in order to be able to gel up with their grandchildren.Majority of senior citizens are neglected by their children and family and they fall prey to depression.   For instance ,when the first time I took leave to give my Engineering services exam ,my boss at IOCL would issue regular threats ,I was busy preparing so didn't give a damn to it .But when I returned back to work after that ,he told all the other staff and my co- officers to boycott me .No one used to speak to me .I was really unhappy .I bought a little labra pup and my world revolved around it .I started talking to him about every damn thing .   Second instance was when I was waiting for my relieving, as I was selected in ESE 2013 with an amazing all India rank of 7 ,in Delhi .Things were not very favourable. I had to go to head office of IOCL in greenpark everyday ,sit there from morning 10:30 to evening 4:30 only to hear that someone was on leave ,someone did not approve ,someone told to write a mail ,all sorts of excuses .I had no clue when would I be relieved ,it started making me anxious and worried each passing day .It's there that I decided I would prepare for UPSC .Sitting in those corridors I started reading basic books for UPSC .And it worked miracles .I started preparing for UPSC quite seriously.And see I have achieved it .   There are more such times when I fought to come out of the worrying situations including relationship storms .But the point I want to make here is not everybody can do this alone .I was fortunate to have some very supportive friends ,my husband ,my parents ,my brother but not all are blessed .From these instances I promised myself that I would always try to help people around me ,if nothing try to be approachable   A couple of days back ,I got a message from my maid's daughter,who was having suicidal tendencies .I tried to help her in the best possible way I could . Kept calling her regularly Called her to my home ,made her do yoga with me . Got her enrolled in python learning programme (she is pursuing computer science engineering from a private college) Her basic grievance was that no body is listening to her ,she felt she was completely useless ,no one wants her .In sometime she became quite calm and has again started her normal life . My only point here is just look around yourselves and listen to others ,be approachable and you can help a lot of people by being observant .You don't need to be a certified pychiatrist ,only a basic EQ not much IQ would help us to bring back our friends to normal .Keep communicating and keep a track of the lives of near and dear ones .Make them realise that you are there for them ,everytime and anytime .Help each other from coming out of this if you want to prevent the society from collapsing .This is a kind of social transformation and reformation the society is going through .   I urge that anybody who needs help with this can surely approach me .I shall try my best to get you out of it .   Best wishes \ud83d\ude0a   Webinar scheduled on 5th July by me .

An excuse for this is the constant \u201cI'm just tired.\u201d They just stop trying or feel as though they can't do anything so its not worth their time. Hopelessness and\/or helplessness- you feel life is not worth living, there is no hope for the future, Stagnation- They\/you don\u2019t want to get out of bed. ignoring your problems and thinking that by ignoring your problem it will go away but it won\u2019t. It just gets worse. Irritability and bitterness- Everything or anyone becomes a nuisance. They\/you lash out at everyone as if it were their fault you are depressed. Jealousy\/envy- They\/you almost hate anyone who seems to have a better life than yours and you resent them or feel jealous because you don\u2019t have what they have. Bouts of crying and sadness- You realize you have frequent crying spells, which is not how you used to be. You feel sad, empty or numb all the time and you dwell on your misery and can\u2019t seem to escape it Apathy, selfishness and fear\/cowardice- Many depressed people can often forget or choose to forget they have other people to live for hence why they need to get help but some people just choose to remain in their condition, not getting any help and not giving a damn about it. With regards to cowardice is kind of linked to apathy. Cowards are afraid of facing life, making decisions, growing up, taking ownership, and the list goes on. Withdrawing\/Not keeping in contact-this kind of goes along with lack of energy and motivation this person might not be texting\/posting as much as they used to or choose to stay away from people they know and be alone Lack of self-care- this person may not take care of themselves as they used to, whether thats not eating or even as little as not washing their hands. this one can be just a sign someone is lazy or that they might have depression. I have gotten lots of comments about number 12, and the definition of cowardice is lack of courage to face danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, failure, etc. so the fear to face ones problems could be defined as cowardice. Thats all I know just remember not all of these signs are indicators of depression just check in with people and look up more resources online. If you are facing depression please don't try to handle it on your own you probably need outside help.

Your brain is flooded with abnormal thoughts, such as: I am worthless I am unlovable Everything sucks All people are bad The world is doomed Nothing matters Nobody cares I don\u2019t belong One way to self-treat depression (but which is challenging for most people to learn) is to get good at hearing those negative thoughts bubble up from your subconscious. Then, you intercept the thought and discard it from your mind, the way you might pick a crumb off a tablecloth and toss it into the garbage. This is called  negative thought discarding . If you get the hang of it, you can often pull yourself out of a deep depression in about three days. If you try it, expect to have to detect and intercept around 100 negative thoughts per day. It requires focus; you can\u2019t get distracted by complex tasks. The number of thoughts you detect will start to drop as you recover.   Most therapists don\u2019t teach this technique because they get tired of people saying they are going to do it, and then not doing it. You have to be  radically serious  about getting better,  enraged by your condition,  and make it the centerpiece of every moment of your life for a few days until the thought-generator shuts off and you feel better.   The question for you now is not, Does it work? The question is, How much do you trust me? If you\u2019re not sure, go to my profile, click on the questions I have answered, scroll down and read all the ones related to depression, and decide if I make sense.  Depression has been my life\u2019s work. I don\u2019t mess around.   SO. Now you have some insights into why you\u2019re having the thoughts you\u2019re having, and you have a powerful recovery technique to try. For the one out of fifty who actually stick to it for enough days, it can have awesome results. Why not be that person?   By the way, Negative Thought Discarding is the oldest depression treatment technique known to humanity, and has been in use for thousands of years. There are plenty of books about it\u2014most refer to Automatic Negative Thoughts, or ANTS.   Remember, most people find a way to f**k it up. Be the person who executes it as instructed, and you will never fear depression again, for the rest of your life.   Thanks for the question!

But the brain\/body chemistry is basically like a well oiled machine - almost like one of those elaborate domino lines people line up to knock down in a perfectly timed pattern. You need healthy levels of serotonin and cortisol to want to get up in the morning. Otherwise, you feel like 1000lbs or just dreading life outside your room. As well, being in public, dealing with stimulus, the dance of putting on your social face to be around peopleis a layer of inner activity that gets taken for granted, but is tremendously difficult when you\u2019re depressed. The body is trying to handle your wacky levels of neurotransmitters and hormones - it doesn\u2019t have time for that stuff!   The really tricky part about depression is that those events will help you to regain your proper neurotransmitter\/hormone levels, but you need some in the first place to motivate you to do it. You need a little cortisol to get up, or serotonin to feel comfortable enough to be social, or dopamine to get excited for an event; and when you don\u2019t, it literally feel like you\u2019re drowning when others are swimming, numb while others feel connected, and dreading death while others anticipate a party. It\u2019s so hard to start when it\u2019s so painful.   But in a video game it\u2019s reasonable. People will always choose to enter treacherous rooms that have more hidden bonus points; battle bigger monsters because you get more coins or better weapons. They do it because it\u2019s built into the rules and they can rely on the outcome.   If we did this in real life - trusted in the outcome and forced ourselves to do some stuff that might be uncomfortable at first, we could get some healing momentum going.

I had depression for a good 10\u201315 years before I took medications for it because I couldn\u2019t stand the side effects when I was a teen, but they mysteriously went away when I was older and tried again.   Living in that time compared to now was like I was in pitch black darkness being tortured on a chain rack every day physically and emotionally. I look back at my life sometimes and I wonder why I didn\u2019t do more to succeed like normal happy people would have, decide my life purpose, connect with more people, actively make my life and career better, learn more skills, go to college.   Then I remember the pain and darkness, carried like a weight on my shoulders, soaking up the rain from the cloud of malice that followed me everywhere I went. Just getting out of bed felt hopeless, and some days I simply refused and went back to sleep for another 12 hours. I drowned myself in alcohol, didn\u2019t bathe, skipped school and work, got lost in computer games, information diving, dark music, overeating on junk. I was in the grip.   I realize now that if I hadn\u2019t gone through what was among the worst possible things that could have happened to me, I wouldn\u2019t have had any faith in my own power today. Normal, happy, lucky people breeze through life with nothing weighing them down, they\u2019re born in the light and that\u2019s where they live, but the second they hit the shadow of the wall they fall apart. They lose their confidence, it tears their fragile egos up and spits them out like confetti. It\u2019s a surprising thing to see when you see someone you thought was stronger than you trip over what to you looks like a pebble, but to them it\u2019s a mountain.   I believe if a normal, happy, lucky person had had my experience they most likely would not have survived it. I was born in the dark and I lived in the dark, but conversely I have my own troubles with living in the light. I have no reason to believe the good things are real or particularly accessible like others do. Everything is either too good to be true or is an outright trap. That\u2019s how depression changes your personality if you go it alone without medication. The sooner you get medicated and take therapy, the better chance you have of avoiding some of the less pleasant challenges of what I call \u201cthe wall\u201d alone.   While my own view of depression and it\u2019s outlook may sound bleak, I would counter that there are truths on both sides of the wall. Your reward for holding on is that it will make your view of reality more balanced and it will increase your confidence as a skeptic of all that you see. People who have had depression tend to be more realistic because they\u2019re more willing to consider and accept the worst case scenarios even when things are going well for them.   If there\u2019s anything that would keep you going, make it the fact that in the end you will know both sides of the truth.\n\nDepression tends to affect neurotransmitters that play a role in motivation, reward, sleep, sex, anxiety, etc.   Unsurprisingly if you\u2019re not chemically balanced it can make just about every aspect of life feel like you\u2019re in a living hell.

The technical term for what you are feeling is called the Three As- or atleast thats what I call them: anergia, anhedonia, and amotivation.   Anergia is a lack of energy. Anhedonia is a lack of interest in activities that are\/once were important to you. Amotivation is basically lack of motivation- but to the extreme, where you literally almost have apathy about completing or getting anything done.   The reason for these feelings are related to several functions going on inside your brain, including negative thoughts, self defeatism, pessimism, and of course, neurotransmitter fluctuations- especially serotonin.   I encourage you to talk with your medical provider ASAP about your feelings. If you are young, your chance of relapse is higher with each untreated episode of major depression. If this has been going on longer than 2 weeks, you definitely need to discuss treatment options. If you have been considering self harm or already participating in self inflicted behaviors, hospitalization may be necessary for your safety- but also can help you get into and stay in a healthy routine. Please do NOT WAIT.   Of course, there are many non pharmacological interventions as well. I frequently participate in mindfulness meditation, especially self compassion- as taught by Dr. Kristin Neff. She has a wonderful book on this. Other interventions include excercise, healthy diet, psychotherapy, and mind-body practices.   You are loved. Best wishes. AK\n\nFirst, if you are thinking of harming yourself, there is help.

With my father wanted her daughter to be best at everything because I really was very good at everything and a very responsible daughter, this whole depression phase messed up my relationship with my father. His expectations seemed impossible to be me and he would lose his patience with me. I couldn\u2019t tell him what I was going through because I didn\u2019t want to call that depression but he knew something was wrong. But the kind of support I expected from him I never got that. He stopped trusting me and I just lost myself so I have zero confidence over me. I really wanted him to trust me like he did in my school year and my exams but he didn\u2019t. My mother on the hand also knew something was wrong with me and the best part was that she trusted me. She didn\u2019t lecture me over not being productive or sleeping all day she just let me heal and she was just there without any questions. She made me see that there is still a lot to see in life and if there are sad days there are happy days. If it wasn\u2019t for her I would have neve come out of that phase.

Be comfortable in your skin, and be appreciative of the fact that, unlike millions of people, you have the luxury to lie all day in bed.   Now as you comfortably lay on the bed in the afternoon, ask small questions to yourself and then when a fish of energy is created or spiked add small goals to your laidback life.   What's the point of seeing when I can't touch and feel everything, when seeing didn't get me any return? But I still see.   What's the use of eating when it shall become dirt after a while and most of it will exit my body? But I still eat and rejuvenate and energize my body.   What's the point of sleeping all day when it shall restrict my life to a comfortable cage? But I lay on the bed all day.   What's the point of not experimenting with life when my body has energy and my mind has power?   What\u2019s the point of an empty and calm state created by not taking any trouble or not making efforts, when it can get you nothing at all, not even diverse emotions and experiences in life?   What's the point of not living when you are alive?   What feelings would you have after years of similar existence? When you reach your deathbed. When did I live? I could have lived, enjoyed, tried, and experienced. Why didn't I?   What held me back?   All you have done is let your body lose and release the energy that flows through each cell and blood. The body and mind are still much capable. It's you who is throwing away the energy because you are continuously asking yourself why to use the energy?   Why do you need a point for everything in life? Life is to live and not to catch flags on a race track. Because you will have to leave each flag, trophy, wound, and pain at the endpoint. But can't you even pleasantly walk in a garden and feel good about the journey?   One major experience of a few minutes can affect your emotions throughout life or for days and months. If you felt good you can relive the memory as much as you want in your mind.   The point that you are showering and eating shows a hidden urge to live.   Write new motives in life. Write a fresh story in a notebook, and imagine you, the one lying all day in bed, experiencing those moments. Commit to be there through your efforts.   Find a hobby that can get some earnings in your pocket and satisfy your energy levels and skills.   Find a job or start a small business with a purpose to serve, earn, and feel good about life.   Start walking, in the morning and night, walk a lot, gain energy, use energy, be fit, be in momentum, and be active.   Be more aware, read, watch, interact, experience, and write your experiences as a story of life.   Be more spiritually active, begin a pursuit to rise above life, to grow mentally.   Restart your life.   Do visit a psychiatrist if your loss of interest is consistent.   Anubhav Jain\n\nThe \u2018something\u2019 in your question is worse than nothing.

I go very scientifically into any matter and comment only when sure of it going either way - to accept or to negate. Astrology, if read correctly and in the comprehensive manner it is supposed to be, know it to be as certain as the Sunrise of tomorrow, with time.   By the strength of yog-sadhna that I practice for some years now, I can say with conviction that happenings of routine go as per the Planetary movements. This is a universal pattern applicable to all. For the accuracy of it, I quote the Hindu Almanac (Panchang) which was originally drawn thousands of years ago and is still found giving results by minutes and seconds applicable today. The calculations are so precise.   Coming to the next step from there, Planets and Constellations are found to deliver impulse that enters Human body and through a systematic chemical conversion, generates a sequence of Impulse-Conversion-Thought-Action-Result process. Intellect of the individual does not work independent of this sequence, but actually contributes into it.   I concede being slow but prudent in reading Astrological charts. As observed, habits of previous lives influence choice and actions in the present birth. It is actually no surprise for me to notice that each individual birth takes place in accordance to the karma of previous birth. I feel each birth to be in continuity of the previous, essentially. The kind of Death in each case is a very significant contributor to the next travel. The complete system of birth and rebirth is drawn very intelligently. There is no scope of error anywhere. All the accidental deaths we generally refer to as untimely demise of someone, too, are meticulously planned that way. There is nothing as untimely. pics courtesy Google search - for indicative purpose only   Where such intricate planning is pre-arranged for each component in the entire Cosmos, how can a highly important point of Death be overlooked ?

Free will. Dharma.   After death, Atma [the individual Self] continues to carry its dharma and karma. Karma can be divided into two parts: Sanchita and Prarabdha. Sanchita-karma leads to various types of hell and various sufferings in the posthumous existence of the soul, and Prarabdha-karma directs Atma to another body and can be \u201cburned\u201d (\u201cworked out\u201d) only through experience (that is, it can be outlived). Only the most exalted (developed) Atmas, who completely control Indriya (perception), are free from control and from the need to go through the trials of Prarabdha-karma in this life.  Continue Reading Karma. Free will. Dharma.   After death, Atma [the individual Self] continues to carry its dharma and karma. Karma can be divided into two parts: Sanchita and Prarabdha. Sanchita-karma leads to various types of hell and various sufferings in the posthumous existence of the soul, and Prarabdha-karma directs Atma to another body and can be \u201cburned\u201d (\u201cworked out\u201d) only through experience (that is, it can be outlived). Only the most exalted (developed) Atmas, who completely control Indriya (perception), are free from control and from the need to go through the trials of Prarabdha-karma in this life. All other souls are conditioned by the circumstances of Prarabdha-karma.   1. Based on the accumulated Prarabdha karma, God decides the circumstances of birth, trials, and length of life that a person will undergo to complete the current Prarabdha. Sometimes one life is not enough, several rebirths (incarnations, incarnations) are needed. To determine the past fate, use a map built at the time of conception. Much can be learned from the Dvadasamsha chart (D-12) at the time of Nishek (conception).   2. Janma-Kundali [birth chart] for Prarabdha-karma is a complete and accurate Shastyamsha-chart (D-60). It is the most important in the Shodasha-Varga Parasara scheme. The Shastyamsha-Varga (D-60) is the highest (minor) division of the zodiac in the Vimsopaka-Bala scheme, and hence it sets its highest priority over the other Vargas. The same varga talks in detail about Prarabdha-karma, in addition to Navamsha, Rashi, and other Vargas. Their relative importance (priorities) of Vargas are indicated by Parashara in the description of the Vimshopak-Bala scheme.   3. Due to the givenness of the paradigm of karma and rebirth, a person has only a small amount of room for \"free will\" to maneuver. Therefore, there is a feeling that life is a set of inevitable events that a person must endure, just as a prison term is given as a punishment. This is true. But then a difficult question arises: what is the role of Jyotish? How can Jyotish help? And most importantly, how Jyotish can change the inevitable events, that is, how Jyotish can change what cannot be changed since the \"term\" \"punishment\" is set and inevitable. This question has been answered in detail by Harihara, the author of Prashna-Marga. The Prasna Marga treatise was translated by Bangalore Dr. Venkata Raman. After reading this book, all doubts are dispelled, and the great work done by Dr. Raman is understandable.   4. Always, in every incarnation, the Atma [Self] sits (' Arudha ') on the mind (' Manas '), that is, on Chandra [Moon], which controls the body (' Sharira '). Atma remembers all past incarnations, but Manas [mind] is new every time and knows only this incarnation, therefore it cannot understand the cause of various sufferings that it sees and experiences. Mana (Manas) becomes angry when injustice seems to him (based on his current knowledge and concept of justice); this is Mangala [Mars]. This anger ends in grief - until Atma unites with Manas to \"burn\" Prarabdha-karma through this anubhava[an experience]. Here the help and intervention of Guru [Jupiter] are needed. If the Guru is strong in Simhalokamsha or gains strength as a result of worshiping the Diksha Guru \u201cnot a Shiksha Guru (!)\u201d, then the person will follow the path of self-development by reciting the mantras of the hymns of \u201cinvocations\u201d about protection from the intended (according to Prarabdha) trials.   5. Harihara explained the value of Prasna. Prashna tells whether a person worsened or improved his karma from his birth to the moment of Prashna (until the moment of the question). Thus, the karma done in this life is immediately \u201cregistered\u201d by the Chitra Gupta (who resides in the Chitra Nakshatra: hence the connection with the Chitra Paksha Ayanamsha). This immediate registration results in change and impact on the results of the birth chart and have a profound effect on the future.   If the position of the grahas [planets] in the birth chart is better than in the Prasna chart, then the person has fallen (degraded) in this life, that is, he has accumulated more negative karma.   If in the birth chart the planetary positions are worse than in Prasna, then in this life a person has improved his karma and, to the same extent, improved his future.   If Janma-kundali and Prasna-Kundli are equally strong, then a person simply \"floats\" through the experience of this life, holding on to the level of past karma.   Therefore, the result of this karma can change the givenness of Janma-Kundali, including the duration of life (!).   6. It is clear from the above obvious statements that karma done in this life is immediately \"registered\"; and from the same moment, the changed karma immediately affects the future - either near, or distant, or in a subsequent birth. From this, another question arises.   7. This is a matter of free will. What is free will \"freedom of choice, a person's control over his decisions and actions\"? Free will is the ability of a person to choose an action that he performs as a reaction to something or to achieve some goal. Such action is always purposeful, as opposed to unintentional action. This leads to Upachaya-bhavam: bhavas [of houses] 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11thdetermine the actions that a person can or will take depending on the conditions (33% of freedom is limited by rationality, as in the Simonian decision model). Thus, the action itself is limited by various inputs, which is called limited rationality, depending on four factors: 1) information (knowledge) - Buddhi (Dharma-Ayana); 2) resources - Vriddhi [increase in wealth] (Artha-Ayana); 3) abilities that realize desires based on the purity of the goal - Shuddhi (Kama-Ayana); and, finally, 4) time, as the ultimate source of liberation and ending of all karma (both Sanchita and Prarabdha) - Siddhi (Moksha-Ayana). Based on this, the greatest saying becomes clear: \"karma is the right of a person to be born, but a person has no right ('adhikara') to the result.\" This right to freedom of action (' adhikara') is the only inborn right. Harihara, the author of Prashna-Marga, speaks of this.   8. If we analyze the concept of 'sva' [self], then it turns out that Atma is an observer \"witness\" and, therefore, these Upachaya-bhavas show the right to act (realization of free will) not at the level of Atma, but only the process of action and the reactions of Manasa [mind] and Sharira [body] in this manifested, material world. Thus, it is all seen from the Lagna and especially from Chandra [Moon], especially from the 10th bhava [house] from Chandra. Kalyan Varma in the treatise Saravali gave a detailed description of the position of the grahas [planets] and their conjunctions in the 10thbhave from Chandra. Why is so much importance attributed to Chandra in connection with free will? Chandra is the conscious mind in which all actions arise; therefore Chandra - Manaskaraka - is the field for the activity of Maya [illusion]. The Rik Veda speaks very clearly about the creation of this source of all actions in the mind in Vishva Mitra's address to Brihaspati: ' Suchim-arkair brihaspatim advareshu namasyate' - \"May Brihaspati (Guru-Deva, Diksha-Guru), the guarantor of success (in all deeds) give auspicious thoughts (which leads to impeccable actions that create such karma that does not violate the principles of Dharma)\". Obviously, this concept of free will is limited by Mana [mind] and also by Upachaya, that is, those thoughts that are associated with action. This concept of limited free will explains the methods of Vedic remedial measures such as Mantras (i.e. ' Mana ' + ' Tray ' = 'Protection of Mana') which 1) eliminate negative thoughts leading to negative karma and 2) protect against the provocations of poorly passed lessons of past karma that bring anger, grief, passion (Rajas) and ignorance (Tamas). Due to this, free will dominates Manas and raises the level of Manas to Atma (self-realization).   9. Vivaha (marriage and its specific form) is the predestination \"predestination\" in the form of Anubhava. But to say that two have been married for many births and will remain together for many births is normal for a priest concluding a marriage, but not a Jyotishacharya (Vedic astrologer). The astrologer must see the reactions of Manas to the various trials to which he is subjected and due to which he is thrown into disorder (without knowing Prarabdha). It is here \"in marriage\" that he can teach and help if he is aware of the pitfalls and problems that result from incompatibilities such as Kuja dosha and others. Prashna is a very important and effective tool, including for the analysis of karma associated with marital events. In addition, it is necessary to look at the transits ('Gochar') with respect to the positions of Grah[planets] in Navamsa. And men and women are subject to this monthly cycle, only at the same time the man is Purusha. Jyotish Acharya, Jyotish Pandit, Vedic Jyotish Practitioner  \u00b7  2y How do I read a natal chart?

Vedic astrology: natal chart online with decoding How to read a natal chart: what the houses of the horoscope will tell about Before we analyze the natal chart and you learn how to read the natal chart yourself, it is important to decipher the concept of houses. Here is what each house of the horoscope is responsible for: 1st house - your personality, body, health, character; 2nd house - shows your material well-being; 3rd house is the house of self-efforts and siblings; 4th house is the house of the mother, as well as emotions, happiness in life; 5th house - shows your children, as well as intellectual abilities, education and creativity; 6th house - the house of diseases, enemies, obstacles in your life; 7th house is the house of marriage and spouse; 8th house - the house of longevity, longevity and intuition; 9th house - shows your luck in life; 10th house - your profession, work, career aspirations; 11th house - responsible for the fulfillment of desires; The 12th house is the house of expenses and losses.

For example, in the first house you can see what diseases you are predisposed to, in the 2nd house you can see how rich you will be, in the 5th house you can see how many children you will have and how they will treat you. The 1st, 5th, 9th houses (trikona houses) are considered the best, it is very good to have planets here. 6th, 8th, 12th houses are the inauspicious houses of dusthana where any planet goes bad. How to calculate lagnesha? Your jyotish horoscope Lagnesha is the lord planet of the most important, the first house of the horoscope. Often a lot depends on the position of the lagnesha, because it can be in a completely different house. Interpretations according to the natal chart can be very different if we do not take into account the position of Lagnesh. For example, if you have no planets in the first house then it is important to calculate Lagnesh and determine its position. We will need our jyotish map again. So, look at the number in the corner of the first house. This is the sign of the zodiac, where 1 is Aries, 2 is Taurus, 3 is Gemini, 4 is Cancer, 5 is Leo, 6 is Virgo, 7 is Libra, 8 is Scorpio, 9 is Sagittarius, 10 is Capricorn, 11 is Aquarius, 12 - Fishes. In our example, this is the number 6, that is, Virgo. Now we look at the table below to determine Lagnesh. SIGNS:HOST PLANET Aries:Mars Scorpio:Mars Taurus:Venus Libra:Venus Gemini:Mercury Virgo:Mercury Cancer:Moon Leo:The sun Sagittarius:Jupiter Pisces:Jupiter Capricorn,:Saturn Aquarius:Saturn \u2014 Rahu \u2014 Ketu Let's take a an example. we assume that the number in the first house is 2. Remember, the number 2 is Taurus. The ruling planet of the sign Taurus (2) is Venus (see the table above). This will be our lagnesha. Suppose He is in the 11th house of the horoscope. Lagnesha-Venus is very good for the owner of the horoscope. The desires of such a person are always fulfilled, he always gets exactly what he wants. This position can give power and influence in society. Next, we look at what venus symbolism of in order to understand what qualities of character will prevail in a person. It is also important to look at how strong or weak planets are We read the natal chart on our own: what else is important to know you will probably come across the following important terms indicating the planets in the natal chart and their position: *\u00a0The planet is in exaltation - it is in its best position and manifests its good qualities easily and freely. *\u00a0Mulatrikona - \u201croyal degree\u201d, also a good position of the planets, but slightly worse than exaltation. *\u00a0A planet in its own sign is a good position of the planet, but worse than a mulatrikona, the planet shows both good and unfavorable influences. *\u00a0The planet is in debilitation (debilitation), falling - the planet feels the worst of all, it is deprived of strength, bears negative manifestations. The natal chart of Jyotish will definitely indicate which planet you have is exalted and which is debilitated. If at your birth the planet moved retrograde (reversely), then the R icon will be in the chart near this planet.

Free will. Dharma.   After death, Atma [the individual Self] continues to carry its dharma and karma. Karma can be divided into two parts: Sanchita and Prarabdha. Sanchita-karma leads to various types of hell and various sufferings in the posthumous existence of the soul, and Prarabdha-karma directs Atma to another body and can be \u201cburned\u201d (\u201cworked out\u201d) only through experience (that is, it can be outlived). Only the most exalted (developed) Atmas, who completely control Indriya (perception), are free from control and from the need to go through the trials of Prarabdha-karma in this life.

The parents are like our supporting pillar . Now if the parents are not there for you . Then god is supporting you . You need to get mature in early . And become self sufficient . They can handle most of their problems by their own as they were alone since childhood . This is especially true for people born in gandata nakshatra .

According to the scriptures, the age of dead souls is two thousand years, according to the former karma they take birth sooner or later, they can come anywhere subtle and remember everything till before birth.   Sometimes phantom spirits and ancestors enter the body of any person or in the body of a member of the family to fulfil their wishes by appearing in the names of mother Bhagwati, mother Kali, Bheru Ji, Saibaba, ancestor etc. Some good spirits also do good work. In such a family, there is a special crowd on the charge of phantom souls and acts as a description of their suffering. Evil spirits mistreat family friends and torment them financially and mentally and give them severe hardship.   Families with a premature death haunt the ghosts around their family. Good demons give the appearance of fragrance and evil or bad phantom spirits spread the atmosphere of smell.   Similarly, the phantom spirits of the ancestors continue to benefit their family members for ten to twelve generations. Or it hurts. Sometimes they make their presence felt alone or at the time of worship invisibly.   The basis of the demons is Akatatva. By staying in contact with air, this black or its shadow form, or sometimes higher spirits also take the form of gross body for some time, these souls are especially strong in Krishna paksha.   The horoscope and the phantom spirits are closely related. The position of Guru, Shani and Rahu in Janam Patrika indicates the relation of souls to the fruits or effects derived from the deeds of prior karma. The existence or presence of Rahu in the house of Saturn or the house of the latter or the combination of both and the vision or influence of being a master together increases the influence of phantom spirits on the native.   Look at some examples of how Guru, Shani, Rahu affect the birth chart.   1. Guru shows blessings or faults in the soul of ancestors if it is in the Lagna. There is a sense of his presence either alone or while worshipping. Such a person should donate milk on the new moon day.   2. The Guru of the second or eighth position shows that the person had to be born righteous or saintly in the previous birth or else he had to be born again because of some unfulfilled wishes. Such a person is blessed with invisible phantom spirits. All desires are preceded by good deeds and religious instincts. Such people are born in a prosperous house. The latter leads a life full of religious instincts. His life remains simple but happy and finally, he dies.   3. If the Guru is in the third place then it is believed that a woman is persecuted in the ancestors and with her blessings lead a happy life, but being cursed leads to physical, financial and mental troubles. Such people are benefited by worshipping Kul Devi of Maa Bhagwati.   4. When the Guru is in the fourth place, the native comes back from the ancestors and is born in the family. Life is blissful with the blessings of the ancestors. When cursed, such people are found to be suffering from problems. They always have fear. Such a person should go to the place of ancestors and offer prayers once a year and wish for a happy life.   5. When Guru is in ninth place, the shadow of the elderly always helps. Such a person is renounced by Maya and sainted with similar thoughts. As you get older, it will become stronger and more knowledgeable. The badass of such a person also gives a good effect.   6. When the Guru is in the tenth position, the person keeps a saintly tendency, religious thoughts, unwavering shrines on God from the rites of previous birth. On the tenth, the ninth or eleventh place positioned Shani or Rahu, then such a person is an official of a religious place, or a trust or a great saint. Due to wickedness, dishonesty, lies, and corrupts make economic progress, but eventually become devoted to God.   7. On the eleventh place, the Guru tells that in the previous life, the tantra mantra, knowledge of occult mastery or doing some wrong work, corrupted spirits, disrupts family happiness, Mentalntal disturbance is always there. Rahu's transit has to face special problems. Such a person should worship Maa Kali and live in moderation.   8. In the twelfth place, the yoga of Rahu or Shani with the Guru, shows in the previous birth, the blame of breaking the religious place or temple by this person and he has to complete it in this birth. Such a person gives good souls with a similar look. They benefit from religious tendencies. One has to face problems due to wrong eating.   Now see Shani's relation with the demons' and ancestors: -   1. Saturn's presence in Lagna or being in the first place indicates that this person must have been knowledgeable of good vaidya or old things, herbs, esoteric practices in previous lives. Good invisible spirits help such a person. Their childhood is sick or financially troublesome. They live in houses where phantom spirits live. Worshipping bhairava is beneficial.   2. Saturn is believed to be in the second position cause of issues. That such a person suffers financial, physical family problems due to their bad luck by persecuting or causing unjust cause to a person in a previous birth. When Rahu is in a relationship, sleepless dreams, dreams come, or the shadow of a phantom spirit impedes every task in an inimitable manner. Such persons remain mentally disturbed.   3. When Saturn or Rahu is in the third or sixth position, then unseen souls help in predicting future events. Such a person acquires knowledge in the work related to the land, what the house is under the ground. These people are sometimes found suffering from unreasonable fear.   4. In the fourth place Saturn or Rahu signifies the presence of the ancestors in the serpent. Fear of snake shape things or snake. Such People get benefit from serving animals or snakes. Treatment of stomach disease gives success.   5. The presence of Shani or Rahu in the fifth position is considered to cause trouble to someone with a deadly weapon in the previous birth. They have to bear child-related problems. Stomach disease, delayed childbirth, etc. are troublesome.   6. When Saturn or Rahu is in the seventh place, due to pre-birth related defects, you feel lack of eye, physical pain, family happiness. Religious instincts and worshipping your favourite is beneficial.   7. Shani or Rahu in the eighth position indicates that due to wrong use of Tantra-Mantra on a person in the previous birth, they suffer from fear without reason. These people have fear of a snake, thieves remain & people who are dead. Donating milk to needy is useful for their benefits.   8. Saturn in ninth place shows the defect of hindering the progress of other people in the previous birth. the persons are not able to make special progress in the job.   9. Saturn being in the twelfth place is an economic gain or loss due to the blessing or dosha of the serpent. Such a person should wear an all-round silver ring and such people are benefited by worshipping the snake. Offering milk and water to Lord Shankar is also beneficial.   10. There is a combination of Rahu and Shani in any house of Janma Patrika, such a person is suffering from the Upari Hawa. There is always a heaviness in their body, they are found guilty of being lazy, prone to anger and anger while praying.   If the person does pranayam regularly and he feeds the cow, serves the animals, then one can get relief from all these defects.\n\nBirth and astrology   According to astrology, man's age is considered to be one hundred and twenty years, but death can happen at any time due to the spirit and past deeds of ghosts, ancestors. According to the scriptures, the age of dead souls is two thousand years, according to the former karma they take birth sooner or later, they can come anywhere subtle and remember everything till before birth.   Sometimes phantom spirits and ancestors enter the body of any person or in the body of a member of the family to fulfil their wishes by appearing in the names of mother Bhagwati, mother Kali, Bheru Ji Continue Reading\n\nThomas Francisco Pelgero Spiritual Teacher  \u00b7  Author has  2.1K  answers and  5.2M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 5y Some people say that whatever we are going through is the result of our past life karmas and no astrological remedy can change the outcome.

Big question, big answer. I have to write in a wider context, because many people do never have heard these words before. This is not a believe, but a part of a factual description of life. What should be known by all people, because you can easily let go of fears about death. Already one big advantage for everyone.   THE REINCARNATION PROCESS All human Souls are from origin a pure godlike harmonious wise being. Our Souls are created in the image of the loving and kind Soul God. I know this is for many difficult to believe, when you look at thoughts Man formulates and their effects into actions and creations in life. We as angelic beings live as Souls in harmony, health and happiness at a high harmonious energetic frequency in a dimension called Heaven. Our Soul is an immaterial and immortal conscious energetic field, part of God and creates by thoughts energy patterns vibrating at a high energetic frequency. Because Souls are living in a dimension (Heaven) that vibrates only at a high energetic frequency, as Souls we choose energy to flow only in harmonious and balanced frequencies. What means Souls create only harmonious pure positive thoughts. Therefor in Heaven you have only unconditional love, Harmony, Health and Happiness all the time. We can create in Heaven exactly the same positive loving part of life, we have experienced on Earth, only we can instantly change our surroundings and form by thoughts. Souls are perfect creators to change Energy into realities. Mostly as Souls, we create and experience senses and creations far beyond the capability of our human understanding. Sounds are also colors and colors also sounds, all senses are sometimes combined and sometimes they are not, etc. Of course we communicate all the time with all loved ones and others from all kinds of past lives. Nobody dies, everyone lives as a Soul. Heaven is much more real than Earth, if you like parts of Earth and a human life, you surely would love and be much more happier in Heaven. All our Souls are originated from this wonderful inspiring and loving place, we call Heaven. How do I know all this information? We all came and originate from Heaven, only I remember and can see how everything is connected together as a big picture of God\u2019s Creation of Man, Soul and Life. What I gladly share with you. Sometimes Souls desire to experience to become part of a seemingly material life, such as a human on Earth. Where life is created by cause and consequence evolving through repetitive cycles into infinity. What means, that we cannot change our environment or form of energy instantly, but we have become a part of life, like our human life. Where material seems to exist and to be real, and we need to do effort with thoughts and hands to change wood into a house, or find or create food for example. When our Souls desire to reincarnate and to become part of a seemingly material life, Souls descends to the In-between dimension. They pick a human life or other from \u201cthe Most Probable Future\u201d, what is an energetic design of all present moments which have unfolded, are unfolding and shall unfold in our future at that moment. Where Souls can see the preordained future of this vessel in life at that moment. So they see the experiences which are likely to happen in this human life, as Lessons of Life. To create a platform to evolve by these experiences. To evolve means to experience negative situations, created by negative thoughts of you or others and to learn to appreciate and embrace positive thoughts. What is the main purpose of our human life. A human life is a kind of school for the Soul. Souls do not experience negative thoughts, negative emotions or negative feelings in Heaven and desire to experience them in a human life. To be able to learn from them by free will and without prior memories. Some experiences the Soul chooses to experience and contracts are made between Souls to give each other the desired experiences. They are the red line in this human life, and cannot be recreated by yourself in life. Once born, you and others are able to recreate your or others preordained life by choice and free will. Still some desired experiences are fixed on the red line in your life and shall be experienced, for yourself to handle and to evolve in this aspect of life. Or someone else should do something very negative and distort your red line, by their choices. Here you can already start to see how extremely complex and dynamic the Creation of our future is. Still explainable in words. After choosing a specific human or other vessel and established the red line in this life, the Soul \u201csplit\u201d figuratively its Soul in a conscious and subconscious part of the Soul. The subconscious part stays your original part of your angelic Soul, what we call the Higher Self Awareness. This is you too, only you are not conscious aware, you are guiding yourself as Higher Self in life. To create a reality of a human life, therefor the physical and metaphysical worlds are separated. (Meta physical, just means beyond the physical). When you listen to your conscience or intuition, you hear the voice or feel the intention of guidance of your Higher Self.  The conscious part of the Soul, becomes your Awareness. We have to create this \u201csplit\u201d Soul, to create a part of your Soul into your Awareness, what is able to choose between positive thoughts AND NEGATIVE thoughts. The Higher Self is still angelic, and can only formulate positive and pure thoughts. Just like your voice of your Higher Self is conscience and intuition, what is always right, harmonious, good, loving and positive. Your Awareness equals the thoughts you formulate and have in life. When you are born as a baby, this Awareness has the same frequency as your Higher Self, as a Soul as One, or called also enlightened. Because the Awareness did not formulate thoughts as a born baby. That is why people like Jesus said: When you are abound to leave Earth (=dying) and want to find Heaven, you need to be as babies again. To create your Awareness into a pure positive Awareness, by choosing only positive thoughts, to mend your Soul as One. Once born, your Awareness in a human Soul for example, grows up, and chooses between positive and negative thoughts. A good person chooses more positive thoughts than negative thoughts. What means positive thoughts are energetic patterns creating a high energetic frequency. What increases your Awareness to ascend unto your Higher Self energetic high frequency, what means you go the path to enlightenment. To choose all the time positive thoughts is the only way to become enlightened and to mend your \u201csplit\u201d Soul into a Soul as One. What creates your Soul to resonate as One in balance, harmony and true happiness, because of the high energetic frequency of both parts of your Soul. The path to enlightenment in biblical term is to Repent in life, to change negative thoughts you used in the past, into positive thoughts you shall use in your future. A bad person chooses more negative thoughts, than positive thoughts. When a person chooses negative thoughts, than it lowers the frequency of the Awareness and the gap between the energetic frequencies of the Higher Self (=subconscious part of your Soul) and Awareness (=conscious part of your Soul) becomes larger, what creates unbalance, disharmony and unhappiness in yourself. Because the difference in frequencies of the conscious part of your Soul, your Awareness do not resonate well with the Higher Self Awareness. To become enlightened, what I call in-line-ment, means to bring the thoughts of your Higher Self Awareness and your thoughts of your Awareness in line. When your human life cycle ends, you have two outcomes, a balanced and harmonious outcome OR an unbalanced and disharmonious outcome respectively you are enlightened OR not.  A balanced and harmonious outcome is, when you have evolved in your human life and have become completely enlightened as a pure positive Soul as One. Vibrating at a high energetic frequency with your conscious and subconscious part of Soul. When you pass over, your focus of attention of Awareness seems to leave the body, and you shall awaken slowly in the In-Between dimension, what people call \u201cafter life\u201d. To adjust to this new situation in a new dimension without fears or worries. An enlightened person awakens rather fast, and can visit living humans on Earth and than can choose to let go and desire to ascend to Heaven. The Soul can instantly merge the Higher Self and Awareness as One Soul, because both parts vibrate at a high energetic frequency, and instantly the Soul can reenter Heaven. In Biblical terms this person shall not experience a \u201csecond death\u201d. Death means to pass over your focus of attention from one dimension to another. Death does not exist, you only get another perspective at life.  Almost all people end their life cycle without being enlightened. They have still negative thoughts in their ego perspective, what lowers the energetic frequency of the conscious part of their Soul, their Awareness. After their human life cycle ends, they also awaken very slowly in the In-between dimension, and can only observe life at first. To adjust to this new dimension and new situation and that makes dying for everyone a tranquil process, without worries or fears. To die is the same as falling asleep, that is all. Slowly you awaken not in a human reality but in your \u201cafter life\u201d reality in the In-between dimension. Where you feel love surrounding you and feel great. You notice that you are still the same you, only you changed your physical body into an esoteric body that shines light and feels great. Your perspective is still the same as you had in the last human life. Sickness and other obstructions of body and brain are gone. Blind can see, death can hear, and people with a brain obstruction of any kind, can think clear again. When you think about a loved one on Earth, you instantly shall be there and see them in real \u201cearth time\u201d living their lives. You can fly and float around the world and see everything from a different perspective, you can explore the In-between dimension, to see past or future, and much much more.  When you think about a place, you shall be there and see what is happening there in a human reality. You call these passed over Souls, ghosts. Still they are real. Human can\u2019t sense normally these Souls, but they can hear, feel and see you. Why? Because human senses and thoughts work at a low energetic frequency and cannot see the metaphysical world. To keep a human reality intact and realistic. Only some people can through their Soul and using their Observing ability, what works always at a high energetic frequency sense or communicate with them. The Souls live at a high energetic frequency, what separates the physical and metaphysical world. After a while you shall desire to let go of loved ones and Earth for now, to return to Heaven. You should follow as a passed over Soul where love and light is pulling you. Then automatically repentance phase shall start. You have to repent in a human life OR in after life, to mend your Soul. Otherwise you are stuck in the In-between dimension for a very long time. Here you find Karma and \u201cHell\u201d. The pains and sorrow you caused to other people are now experienced by yourself in dreams, as real as a human reality. Why? To learn from your mistakes. Then in new dreams you shall get new choices to make, and when you choose negative thoughts with your ego perspective again, you shall experience more negativity to learn from them. Again you get choices, to choose positive or negative thoughts. This repeats as long as it necessary to create from you a positive, good, loving, angelic Soul again. For some, it takes months, years, decades or even centuries. A lot of passed over Souls, do not know what to do or to deal with negativity on right positive way. So they make over and over again the same mistakes. These words are very important for your human life AND after life. Everything you study in this human life, you shall know also in your after life. And you shall know what to do and what to do not.  How larger your ego perspective filled with negative thoughts, we call sins, how longer you need to repair your Soul. You shall experience all the pains and sorrow you caused to other and Nature, in the end to learn from them. This repentance phase by work, to actively change your negative thoughts into positive thoughts, is again the path to enlightenment. What we call a kind of school detention, because you did not finish your evolving process in a human life. When you created or cooperated to create a Hell for people, animals or Nature on Earth, you shall experience the same kind of Hell in your afterlife. Just to give you the same experience, so you learn from them. How worse you lived in your life, how worse you create your own afterlife. Like karma. Once you managed to transform all negative thoughts into positive thoughts with the intention of your Soul, you have ascended your Awareness to the same high frequency of your Higher Self and can merge together as One Soul. What is biblical called a \u201csecond death\u201d. Because you completed the Repentance phase the In-between dimension and are able to ascend and to reenter a new immaterial pure positive dimension vibrating only at high frequency, what is called Heaven.  We can choose to dissolve negative thoughts from our human life, or we have to dissolve them in our after life. This makes for all Souls a human life always a success. Because even after millennia in the In-between dimension (after life) for some Souls, all shall go through this process of Repentance and return to Heaven. Perfectly and kind created by God. It is just a choice, how long you like to spend wasting your time in repetition of Lessons of Life in a human life or after life. It is just YOUR choice. This means also that Karma, is solved, before we return to Heaven. This means you can never have unfinished business of a past life, or punishment of a past life. This is nonsense. What is possible is that Souls choose similar events in a human life, to see if they can handle this negative experience better in this life. So by regression therapy or when you are young you can see visions of a past life, to emphasize a part of your experience you are going to endure in your future or already experiencing in this present moment. The vision of a past life and what happens to you in life, can help you to cope with the situation you experience in a human life more easier and better. Visions of past lives are given to us by our Higher Self to help us to understand life better. When you as Soul arrive in Heaven you shall go to your world, where a lot of friends shall wait for you and embrace you. Yes, you can feel a hug too in Heaven. Also to communicate about their and your Soul experiences in a human life. You shall love to see everyone, also the people who did harm you in a human life. Because as an angelic Soul, you understand everything about life and have forgiven everyone and visa versa. Here you shall see all your loved ones, who already passed over again. You shall not be amazed, because you already know Heaven, God, Souls and how to live in Heaven.  Until the time comes, you start to desire to reincarnate again and everything starts over again to give you a new experience in your Soul\u2019s life. Our vessels grow in our apparently material dimension and is created by cause and consequence through repetitive cycles into infinity by Souls like Nature of Earth and others. Everything what is and happens on our world is created by Souls. Every drop of rain, every growing cell and everything that exist. Nothing exist without a reason of an expression of a Soul creating energy into a reality. Cause and consequence. The evolution of our apparently material dimension is designed by God and manifested by all Souls including yours, mine and God. Man, neither understood life nor God.   The time you are born, the celestial systems are at a specific place, what indicates a specific time in a cycle of life. In life you have trillions of cycles in cycles moving and evolving along cycles. Because everything is connected, and repeats itself through cycles and you shall experience the same kind of experiences. For you to handle it positively or negatively. To grow above all negative thoughts of your ego perspective and to grow above all negativity of life, by choosing always positive thoughts, which are good for you AND at the same time good for all other people on the world AND at the same time good for Nature. What shall create harmony and balance in yourself, between others and with Nature. All other thoughts are negative thoughts and create disharmony and unbalance in yourself, between each other and with Nature. You are a Soul experiencing to have a human life. Your vessel is like a car with options as genes, astrology and numerology to express your abilities of your Soul and respectively your experiences ahead in life according to the cycles.   The outcome in our human life as a cycle has always two outcomes; a positive or a negative one respectively a harmonious or a disharmonious one. Why? Because a human can choose positive and negative thoughts with its Awareness. Why does astrology or numerology always give you two options, because it depends on your choices what you choose to do next. Some numbers or emphasized information is given to you in life, to give you direction to guide you by your Higher Self or even the Angels. Angels who are there to help human to guide in life to their desires.   When you focus all the time on negative issues in life, you shall create more negativity in your life. Why? Because you do not learn from the negativity and did not change your negative thoughts into positive thoughts. In that case you receive more negative situations or meet negative persons as Lessons of Life, to give you new opportunities to evolve. What is called by some also Karma. Karma can visit you in a human life, or even in our after life. What means what we create is what we shall experience in life or in after life for ourselves AND at the same time for all other people in life too. We have gotten free will of God to create in life. Only with free will comes responsibility which Man forgot. And chose and prefer most of the time negative thoughts above positive thoughts, what resulted in a disharmonious world.   We have to look at negativity in ourselves, others and in the world, to create the desire to change and create something better. And then really change negative thoughts into positive thoughts of ourselves, others and the world. The ego destroys our guidance, get rid of ego and live life, as it was meant to be.   Life is all about evolving thoughts and evolving by the right positive choices. Causes have consequences in this human life and our \u201cafter life\u201d.

Most of the confusions in our mortal life are primarily due to the fact that we try and interpret everything from our own perspective rather than trying to change the perspective to observe the actual truth. What seems true or justified from one point of view, doesnt necessarily have to be the actual truth. A child or an illiterate man might think that the Earth is flat, but that doesnt make the Earth flat in reality.   So first of all, I'll have to object to the very definition of your question. You may think of some people being punished by Karma while others enjoy a better future. Yes indeed, some are lucky and others might have just been dealt the wrong hand, but that too is nothing more than karma. Neither a punishment, nor a blessing.   Yes it is true that karma does not impact all of us equally. And there is a very important reason for it.   Think of a glass with water in it kept under a tap. And then think of a bucket, kept below the glass. If the tap is partially open, the glass would fill slowly. If fully open, it'll fill quickly. If there is a hole in the glass, water would leak and thus fill slowly. If there is a giant hole, the glass may just remain empty and all water might leak into the bucket.   That is all that happens. The water still remains in the bucket, just that it will leak out of your glass. When you buy yourself a new glass, you will be able to fill it with water from the bucket. But the same glass is so damaged, that you just cannot fill it completely no matter what you do. It will leak. The Vedic scriptures talk of multiple yonis in which a soul is subjected to wander. These yonis are qualitative evaluation of life which helps identify the primary driver of our life. Whatever be the objective of your life, similar would be the results experienced.   These yonis are what has been depicted in our mythological stories. There are manushya yonis (birth in a human form) where karma dominates and whatever one gets is the consequence of karma; deva yoni (birth in a divine form) where luck dominates and good\/bad deeds make no immediate disruptions to life; pret yoni (ghost\u2019s form) where the tone of life is set such that the person always keeps on wanting something and yet is unable to get it despite the best of efforts.   Think of a manushya yoni as a perfect glass, but empty. Whatever pours out of the tap, is what falls in the glass. Nothing to do with the bucket. Which is to say, your own karma (flowing tap water) is what is your result (water in glass) in the current life (glass) and has nothing to do with your previous karma (bucket water). Likewise, think of the deva yoni as a perfect glass already filled with bucket water. Any tap water that falls, will overflow to the bucket. And whatever water is there in the glass, has nothing to do with the tap water. It has come from the bucket and would remain the same. And same as this, think of the pret-yoni as a glass with several holes. Whatever water was already there (from the bucket), will leak to the bucket. Whatever water you pour in it, would also fall to the bucket. What remains in the glass, is just emptiness. Not all consequences can be born in this life, not all your actions can lead to results in this life alone. Moreover, if contradictory karma exists, they can only be experienced one at a time. Some deeds are so absolving, so pure, that they do not just add water to your glass; but rather, they end up giving you a perfect glass. Which is to say, your birth and the nature of your birth itself gets altered. Even in your worst possible situation, you\u2019ll reap good results. And even your most horrible sins cannot damage your glass in this lifetime.   On the contrary, some crimes are so heinous, so inhuman, that they end up not turning the tap off or reducing water level of the glass, but rather they damage your glass itself and its ability to hold water.   Here, water are the fruits of your good karma; emptiness or rather the absence of water (of glass or bucket) is the consequence of bad karma; bucket is the total collection of all your good and bad karma; and the glass is your current lifetime. Whatever is in the glass, is meant to be experienced in this lifetime. And how good or bad the glass is, tells you which karma it\u2019ll hold and how much.   There are some crimes, that just create a result. Like you hit someone, they hit you back. Your karma created an experience. But some crimes, like murder, killing a fetus, rape, etc. are severe enough that they end up damaging the vessel\/life and in turn affect all future experiences. Now, if you glass is fragile, or if your current lifetime is malleable; the karma will create suffering in this lifetime itself. But if you have an unbreakable glass as a consequence of previous good karma; sins, even the most heinous ones, will overflow to the bucket. And as a consequence, in your subsequent lifetimes, those sins will materialize as a defected glass for the next life.   Depending on what yoni you\u2019re born in, what type of life is set for you; Karma and destiny materialize accordingly. For some, good\/bad actions may give instantaneous results, for others they may not. Some may yield the fruits of good deeds quickly but face consequences of bad deeds at the fag end of life; while others may first face consequences of bad deeds and then get consequences of good deeds at the end. It depends on when and how the karma can bring its effects. Now, coming to the astrology of it; the soul and destiny are controlled by the 9th house and Sun.   Any afflictions to these house is incurable. And any strength to these is undeniable. A weak moon can be cured, a weak Venus can be remedied, a weak Saturn can be improved; because all of these are in your hand. The mind (Moon) can be controlled by knowledge; the karma (Saturn) can be controlled by building character and the lust (Venus) can be controlled by devotion. But if the weakness is that of the soul (Sun), no remedy, no prayer will overcome it.   Likewise, if you\u2019re lazy (10th house), you can be made to work hard by force. If you\u2019re unhealthy (6th house), you can be treated and monitored. But if you\u2019re unlucky (9th house), nothing can take that away.   And in effect, the strength of Sun, lagna and 9th house determine whether you have a good or a defective glass. The dasha\/transit only determine at what rate water would flow from the tap.\n\nPerspective is very important before making a judgement. Most of the confusions in our mortal life are primarily due to the fact that we try and interpret everything from our own perspective rather than trying to change the perspective to observe the actual truth. What seems true or justified from one point of view, doesnt necessarily have to be the actual truth. A child or an illiterate man might think that the Earth is flat, but that doesnt make the Earth flat in reality.   So first of all, I'll have to object to the very definition of your question. You may think of some people being punished  Continue Reading\n\nSreeram Srinivas Author has  5.8K  answers and  16.2M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Updated 4y Related According to Vedic astrology, why do some people have problems with their mothers?

I really hate my family and I know if I kill myself like my sister did, theyd say \u201cshe was mental I told you so\u201d. However I\u2019m less mental than all of them!!!   I have few friends but for support I use Samaritans - Ive done self development, Ive used 12 steps of anonymous programmes to stop my addictions (sex, porn, masturbating, alcohol, workaholism, etc), trained professionals through our National HEalth Service (NHS)   I accept I will always be alone because I\u2019m a freak - compared to the rest of society; Im a vegan, I dont drink, I dont sleep around anymore, I dont drink caffiene, eat fried food, go clubbing, etc   You get the idea, I \u2019m a freak but as im 46 - Ive learnt a lot about myself over the years and I really like who I am. I dont care if other people like me or not - guarantee they wont!   My family gaslighted me my whole life to be what THEY want me to be, not what I wanted! I hate my vile family\u2026and because Ive disowned them I can focus on me   I\u2019ve been watching Netflix and I find theres a lot I like on there. I love the movies with a tidy happy ending - however delusional!!!   This is the best I have. (by the way I could probably write 1,000 words to this question) but check my other posts if you like this. I know I write too much but I have a lot to say a lot of wisdom to part   I am glad you are considerate of your cat, cos my sister died and left hers\u2026.more so she left me! If you die, you have no idea the pain you cause. My sister killed herself 4.5 years ago and its like Im doing stupid spiritual stuff to get closer to her - but shes gone and I will never be close to her. AND I CANNOT BE HER!!!   I dont have a purpose to my life but to just try and do the best I can each day\u2026I think accepting how stupiid, pathetic and pointless life is helps. Cos speaking my TRUTH is all that matters. I hate working, I hate living with people, I wish I could go on holiday etc   Do you wish for a holiday? Do you have money for one? Can you tell someone why you\u2019re depressed? Cos I only want to kill myself whenever I get annoyed or angry (for example im job hunting and now I will have to lie to get a job and I never wanted to do that - so the last 2 months Ive been resisting that)\u2026now I think who cares!!!!   I am glad to go down roads Ive never been down, guaranteed Iwill not be meeting my next partner, or getting married or kids (after my sexual assault as an indian women from a strict family - I knew I could never have an arranged marriage after that) HOWEVER WHO CARES IF I DONT HAVE KIDS!!!   Would I want a child to grow up in this toxic world, no. However I like trying to be better at life, despite all the stupidiy\u2026and thats what Id wish for you. Some sort of reason to stay here   I think I am the reason I live, cos I have learnt to laugh at how stupid it all is. And when someone does something really horrible or weird etc I can go \u2026.at least im not that person   I take pride in who I am, and once I get my next job - I plan to join the gym - again all pointless but Id like to do have some muscles in my arm that can do something! haha   its the little things that are important, cos the rest of the world makes me want to scream. From stupid interviews to writing a look at me\/but Im stupid too resume, to going on dating sites where youve been ripped off (no-one replies) to the weather, state of the government\/planet - sewages in our british seasides, vile people where ever you go \u2026.I find I am the peace I seek. Cos I am the sane one (I like to think!!!)   I shouldnt be alive, based on how much trauma and vile people I have tolerated - but I get comfort from im still standing. And because I understand all my trauma, family gross upbringing I can share it wasnt my fault. Its not your fault\u2026women who love too much by robin norwood changed my life   I decide how I feel about me, not some family member or boss - they dont know me. I am not going to be depressed about my flat mate being very dirty - its her problem. However I protect myself as best as I can, I remind her to keep her stuff in her fridge shelf or wipe the sink (or I dont)   Life is so so hard - I dont forget that and then Im kind to me and Im strong to say FORGET THEM - life was always about you and no-one else. What can I do for me today?   Today I started to lie more on my CV, I found a stupid job I want, and tomorrow I\u2019ll keep changing my CV to try to get this stupid job. So I can buy a stupid house, in a stupid town, in this stupid life   But its mine and no-one can mess with that. I will always have my own back, and that means not hating or gaslighting me = how the rest of the world does cos im an intelligent indian woman   im sure you have a similar tale, cos I dont think un-traumatised people want to die - its those who have been hurt, lied to and abused \u2026it was never your fault. Put the blame on them, be responsible for your part but as I say about my family I acccept my parents were traumatised by their messed up parents I can give them 50% empathy for that - but the other 50% were they\u2019re vile to me I dont forgive, forget or ignore. i will no longer allow my mom to abuse, gaslight or affect me\u2026she\u2019s to blame for how she treats me badly. And she wants to treat my brother better cos hes a man - good for her   It\u2019s not my problem, I have enough of my own !!! haha (she can get out of my life though)\u2026unless she calls me now, I won\u2019t bother to be a \u201cGood\u201d daughter. I have nothing to prove   See I wrote 2000 words!!! haha hope some of this helps\u2026!\n\nIve used Samaritans in the UK - its a suicide helpline (they are a neutral voice, so they aren;t supposed to stop suicides).

My question is what are these people doing on Earth ? Why don\u2019t they migrate to another planet if they are here just for themselves and not care about people around them.

Perhaps, the people around them are busy checking their mobile phone, have social phobia, lost faith in humanity or whatever reason, they just don\u2019t want to connect with real people.   I am one of those who tries to connect with people, smile and say hello to anyone I meet, including my neighbor\u2019s dog.   When I enter an elevator in my apartment, there are 2\u20133 people around me who know me well but I see them fiddling with their mobile phone. It is just a 5 second journey to my residence at 4th floor. They could well say \u2018Hello, How are you ?\u2019 It takes no more than 5 seconds.   But, they won\u2019t talk !! They will check their mobile phone and behave as if I don\u2019t even exist. That is quiet annoying actually.   To be honest, being ignored is equivalent to ostracism - a punishment called solitary confinement as if you are outcast and do not belong to a group. This makes people psychotic, lonely and angry. This is one of the major cause of depression.   That is exactly where our modern society is heading towards.   On the other hand, we also know people and I strongly believe, there need not be a romantic connection with people to have a conversation. You can just talk to people, across regional\/national boundaries so that you don\u2019t feel alone.   It\u2019s only when each one of us change our attitude towards each other that we will have less lonely people and suicides in this world.   So, when you see someone go for a walk alone, ask him\/her \u2018Are you okay ? May I join you?\u2019.   And, don\u2019t just label them as a loner.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that we live on a planet that has a population of around 7 billion ( maybe more ) and with access to people, at the touch of the button, that a lot of people feel lonely and have suicidal thoughts.

This is from personal experience and I have seen many lives transformed right before my eyes.   You can make Krishna your friend\/ lover\/ son or anything and everything that's missing in your life.

It\u2019s different for everyone, there\u2019s lots of suicidal people who begin to live a reclusive lifestyle and shut themselves away from anyone whereas there\u2019s some suicidal people who actually seek attention (in the wrong ways) but in terms of productive ways of dealing with loneliness and suicidal ideation really does depend heavily on who\u2019s in your life and what relationships you\u2019re involved in, I\u2019m a former suicidal person who nearly killed myself in the post Covid year, now luckily for me my relationship with my family was very good and it made over coming suicidal tendencies easie Continue Reading Hey buddy!!!

All these things need to be put into consideration for suicidal people who have it good for themselves, I know it\u2019d be easier said then done because I\u2019ve been in that headspace myself. Finally the absolute BEST thing to do for a suicidal person is make sure they\u2019re safe and not plotting to kill themselves in a certain way whether that\u2019s swallowing lots of pills or cutting their wrists or hanging themselves, this is easily the most frightening thing for parents and loved ones because if they do have a plan in mind that\u2019s when the alarm bells ring and they need extra care, I was put in a psychiatric clinic and if that\u2019s where they need to be to get intensive treatment for whatever is driving them to suicide then so be it. Suicide is a touchy subject and it should be catered with extreme care, love your family, love your friends and know that you matter \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udef6 thanks for the question mate.\n\nHey buddy!!!

And the worst part is that you do not feel the need to talk to someone, and gradually you start isolating yourself.   If left unheard, loneliness can convert into suicidal thoughts. Suicide refers to taking your life intentionally. These thoughts have abstract feelings like thinking people will be better off without you, or your life does not make any sense and eventually end up your life.   It is an overwhelming feeling, and you are not alone. Most people face suicidal thoughts once in their lifetime. Basic symptoms include: Hopelessness. Overwhelming negative thoughts. Unending pain. Fascination with death. Physically numb your body. You might experience: Lack of sleep. A desperate need to avoid other people. Loss in appetite or weight gain. Low self-esteem. Neglecting self-care. If you are struggling with such issues and need  counseling for Suicidal thoughts , make an appointment with Iskon. Their counseling helped my child in many ways I cannot explain. I almost lost him, but luckily Iskon counselors guided my son with a direction that was lacking in him for a while.   They helped him by teaching: Ways to thank and believe in God. A deeper understanding of how religion works and how the materialistic approach affects you in a harmful way. Ways to achieve a healthy balance in lifestyle. Sun dancing and chants to stay grounded. Ways to keep a positive attitude in daily life.\n\nEvery one in ten individuals is a patient of loneliness and suicidal thoughts. What is loneliness?

In that way, in the way that loneliness is at times a temporary, even though at some of those times a very painful feeling, the pain of loneliness goes away.   Suicidal thoughts, however, while possibly related to the \"condition\" of experiencing loneliness for prolonged spans of time, are more dangerous and insidious because they aren't really about an immediate feeling or emotional state, strictly speaking. Instead, they are about a course of action one's brain has come up with to remove or get around what it considers to be unacceptable pressures, irreconcilable differences between what one\u2019s life is, at least in one or more ways that are important, and the way we suppose life should be. Continuing on in that way, or being forced to face situations that we think can only get worse and that we also find unacceptable, we propose to ourselves the \u201csolution\u201d that we will simply opt out.   Both of these things, however, loneliness and suicide, need not take over our consciousness, nor evict all hope we have about a worthwhile today and better days to come. There are a multitude of people who have escaped both, glad and happy to share about how they are grateful that they didn\u2019t jump off that wall, swallow those pills, or pull that trigger, at least not at their heads.   Seek them out. Seek out the wise counsel of extremely experienced therapists who maintained their interest in humanity despite the many seemingly futile discouragements they ran into, or seek out the support of new therapists who are genuine in their love for mankind and enthusiastic in their application of their intellect and emotional resources to help people like me and you, people prone, perhaps, to discouragement, rejection, loneliness, emotional pains of one type of another.   They can be our teachers, helpers, friends, coaches; inputters of vitality into our see-scapes, until we begin, on our own, to \u201csee\u201d some things differently and then act to bring about a better ending for ourselves rather then just giving up and doing ourselves in.   Good luck Hansi Mittermeier if this applies to you; I know it can be rough going at times, but I believe if you stick with it, things will turn about.\n\nLoneliness has an end to it, in terms of it coming up as a poignant feeling or awareness of not being understood, or not having anyone with which to share something important to us personally, or of not having anyone that cares about the personal details of our daily lives.

Now the demons are \u201cevident\u201d so I can see the reason for my response. I am not saying that others may have a similar problem. But there are surely reasons why we act in certain ways.

The time is past to say something, I just have to sit here until someone notices I don\u2019t have food, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to happen. Someone has to notice. I\u2019m not really invisible. Or am I?   I was forgotten. I\u2019m very frustrated. I feel so lonely and hurt.

They see that the only flavor I\u2019m tasting is the salt in my tears, while they\u2019ve been feasting. Yes, they all feel terrible. I get more than enough food right then, and I calm down.   My family never forgot me at dinner again, and I thought I was okay. I didn\u2019t realize something was wrong.   The first time it happened I didn\u2019t realize.   Not on the second. Or third.   After a few dozen incidents - still no.   Hundreds of misunderstandings, confusion, awkward situations, missed deadlines, no friends, lost chances; I started picking up on it.   It was sometime between the 1,274th and the 1,313th episode that I realized.   Overthinking anything social, avoiding people because of some unforeseen bad result, worrying about every interaction, missing things, stopping talking with people because I knew they couldn\u2019t put up with me (and even when they had expressly told me they liked me), not utilizing free resources because it meant I had to talk to someone at the resource desk, not discussing anything with counselors.   Losing time, losing money, missing out on much of life, not being able to \u201cbe myself\u201d around family, having to copy people\u2019s personalities because I couldn\u2019t maintain an idea of what I needed to say right, avoiding calls unless absolutely necessary, losing my vision during a video presentation and my heart pounding and hot face and sweating, misunderstanding overt cues, unable to speak, powerless to affect the outcome.   It took me way too long to realize that it\u2019s not normal to be anxious about nearly every interaction with people I have.   I know I had high competence when alone or left to my own devices. I solved problems easily, understood any schoolwork, and taught myself practically everything \u2014 rarely depending on my parents to explain concepts or ideas.   Despite being intelligent, my mind blanked when talking to people, when people heard or looked at me, in public, on the phone, looking over my shoulder, and in any conceivable social setting.   The older I get, the harder it is to freely express myself when the expectation or \u201drules\u201d for my behavior overwhelm me. In reality, I\u2019m the problem; nobody has ever cared as much as I do.   It took me way too long to realize social anxiety is not normal.   I\u2019m working on forgiving myself for the pain, and the stupid things I\u2019ve done because of it. Change is difficult, and I hope it\u2019s not impossible.

It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

Anxiety is described as having an increased heart rate, often without an obvious cause.   Anxiety is not always without cause, and that is not the only manifestation of being overwhelmed.

I saw a woman while I was on a part time job in medication rehab in the 1970\u2019s. She was using Valium, a benzodiazepine, at 245 mg a day. Normal dosing was 5 mg every 8 hours, back then that was a heavy dose. So she came in to reduce her dose.   Today we use things like Xanax 1\u20132 mg every 8 hours. They have other less potent ones called Ativan which are usually used for less anxious people. But they all still have that potential for psychological addiction.   There is a much older drug that has not been put on the schedule list, at least not in Florida. It is called hydroxizine pamate which can be used for anxiety, but again it\u2019s not recommended for long term use. No longer than 4 months is suggested.

If you have been dealing with anxiety for some time now then you should know the signs that your about to have an attack such as rapid thundering heart beat and cold sweats ( that is at least how I feel). When you think your going to have an attack just kindly remove yourself from the situation. Now just take 5 or 10 minutes and just reaffirm yourself. Tell yourself that you are ok and it's just the anxiety. Once you recognize that anxiety is the problem and your not dying and that nothing is really wrong, you will start to call down. Then just find a way to ease yourself back into the situation. If you have a close friend or coworker there try to just talk to them for a few. You will start feeling much better and be able to continue what you were doing.   Also, mental health issues don't have the stigma it used to. Make sure you explain to your significant other or friend\/coworker what is wrong. I know for me personally when I'm having an anxiety attack I need to be left alone, but others always want to help or ask what they can do. However, there is nothing anyone besides me (you) that can help. So make sure they know that. If people keep coming up to you during your short 5 minute calm down, then you won't call down at all.   So really the steps are Take 5 or 10 minutes to yourself, and tell yourself \u201cNothing is really wrong, it is only the anxiety.\u201d Make sure your significant other or close friend \/ coworker understands what's wrong so they will leave you be plus help keep others away. Gently reinsert yourself into the situation by talking with just 1 person first. A bonus 4th step. Make jokes about the anxiety to the other people. I find that acknowledging the anxiety to others really helps in fighting the anxiety. I really hope thus helps. I know living with anxiety us awful, but there are ways to make it at least a bit better (without drugging yourself).\n\nHi Meg!

And so, you may feel that would the kind of treatment others would subject you to. The opposite of fear is love. If this is your case, give freely of your love to others. Be accepting. Don't judge.

I recovered from schizophrenia, and worked very, very hard for about 15 years to come up with some good solutions.  Here's what has worked for me.   1.  Look at your symptoms.  Make a list of them.  Think about what it is that you don't think is working for you in your life.   2.  Make a second list.  This is a list of all the physical activities and exercise that you like to do, or might like to do, or at some point might imagine yourself doing.  Make a very long list.  Include things that are just on the edge of what you might like to do.   3.  Make a third list.  This is a list of all the foods, medicines, drugs, or other inputs to your body that might possibly cause you to be aggravated.  Think about both the initial effect of the food and also what happens some hours afterwards.  Write down anything that you can think of, including common food sensitivities, like wheat, dairy, or other things.   4.  Make a fourth list.  This is a list of all the creative and social activities that you enjoy doing, or have ever thought of doing, or might think of doing in the future.  Make a very, very long list.   Next:   5.  Get an immense amount of exercise.  Get something like 20 hours per week of exercise.  This should give you enough endorphins to make you feel good, and might be therapeutic, if you are lucky.  Pick some activities from list number two to try.  Pick the easiest ones.  Start slow.  Be successful.   6.  Pick something to cut out of your diet and see if that makes any difference in your symptoms.  Look at your third list to pick something.  The way you do this is: remove the thing from your diet for a couple of weeks.  See how you feel.  Then, add back a lot of it into your diet, quickly.  See how you feel after that.  If you feel worse when you've reintroduced it, then maybe think about removing that thing from your diet for good.  Repeat with the other things on your list, if you like.   7.  Pick a few things from your fourth list, and add them into your life.  Start slow.  The goal is to be successful, so do the easiest ones first.  Build yourself up with the activities.  Do the ones that make you feel safe.   8.  Take stock of your first list and see whether some of your symptoms have gone away, or if you notice other symptoms that you hadn't seen before.  It's a slow process.  Be good to yourself.   That's it!  You're worth success and recovery.  You are.   Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor, and what I've written above is only my experience with my own personal recovery.  Everyone is different.  You know yourself better than anyone.

Avoid triggers. Work on your temperament. Involve in activities which calm you more than making you anxious. Learn and develop something new in you. Be consistent on what you opt for and this will gradually improve. You need to be more patient and mentally quiet for better results.

Essentially, you are trapped in your head with these obsessional thoughts that tell you  everything   will   not be fine, but awful.  You find yourself stuck in fear. It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

However, this answer is not based only on my years of studying mental health, but also on my personal battle with anxiety.   As a child, when I had anxiety it would manifest as digestive issues or stomach aches. These are the physical symptoms of anxiety. Even today when I am anxious about a big interview or some important matter, I keep running to the loo.

Annoying!   A slight delay in your plans? Annoying!   Your partner singing too loud? Annoying!   The delivery guy getting confused with the directions? Annoying!   Basically, you can get easily irritated by almost anything when you are anxious.   2.  The Freeze Mode   Anxiety can freeze you to one stop. You may sit on your bed all day long, stuck in your mind about all the things that could go wrong!   Anxiety escalates overthinking. It forces you to imagine all possible scenarios. I mean, things that are probably never ever going to happen. But your anxious brain will be like, \u201cHey what if\u2026?\u201d   3.  Abandon Everything and Run For The Hills   Anxious people are always on the lookout for dangers. When they perceive even the slightest danger, their inner alarms will go off, promoting them to take immediate action.   Eg: A girl has relationship anxiety. If she detects a slightest change in her boyfriend's tone, her brain will be overcharged with all the possible explanations. Next thing you know she is planning how to break up with her boyfriend.   What I mean here is that people with anxiety generally become impulsive when triggered. Their reaction may not be entirely rational to the situation in hand.   4.  Physical Complaints   Mind and body are strongly connected with each other. When you have high anxiety, it will manifest as physical health issues because that is the only way you will start realising that something is wrong.   Constipation, loose motions, nausea, chest pain, stomach ulcers, frequent cough & cold, body aches, headaches are some of the health issues linked with anxiety.   Being in a state of constant anxiety can f##k up your immune system making you prone to infections, diseases and Illnesses.   I am a personal evidence of that. There was a time when I used to be so anxious that I would hardly eat and whatever I ate, I would puke. Guess what happened? My platelets came crashing down and I caught Tuberculosis.   Always remember that your mind and body are strongly linked with each other. You have to take care of both. Oh, not to forget your soul too \ud83d\udc93   Now, there are many other symptom of anxiety as well. I could quote the DSM-V, but the bottom line is that you need to take holistic care of yourself. Anxiety for whatever reason is not worth it. It ruins your daily life, sense of self, career and relationships. If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety then talk to a trusted friend or even a psychologist.   Prioritize your happiness and health \ud83e\udd70   ~ Your Trusted Therapist\n\nI am a psychologist.

Environmental stress refers to the stressful events that you have seen or experienced. For example, life events that are often linked to anxiety disorders include child abuse and neglect, the death of a loved one, or being attacked or witnessing violence. Withdrawal of drug abuse. Certain medications can be used to hide or lessen specific anxiety symptoms and often go hand in hand with alcohol and substance use. Medical conditions with heart, lung, and thyroid conditions can cause symptoms much like anxiety disorders or make anxiety signs worse. Therefore, it is important to have a complete physical exam to rule out other situations when talking to your doctor about anxiety. Symptoms   Just as we each have multiple things that stress us out, our symptoms can also be different. Here are some things you may experience under stress. Chronic pain Insomnia Lower sex drive Digestive problems Eating too much or too little Difficulty concentrating and making decisions Fatigue Sleep problems Signs of Stress   Stress can be both long-term and short-term.

As I said, I\u2019m no proffesional to be sure If I have it or not. People around me don\u2019t believe me, my parents too, so they wouldn\u2019t let me go to a psychologist. I know shy people and I know I feel worse than them in social situations. I know my ,, shyness\u201d doesn\u2019t only come down to being shy in front of strangers or nervous when I talk to a crowd. I\u2019m anxious all the time. Just before I enter my classroom every morning, my stomach clenches. I\u2019m not a new student and I\u2019m not being bullied or scared by any of my classmates. I get shortness of breath before I meet up with my friends. Friends I\u2019ve known for over 10 years. I avoid or get nervous sometimes even when I talk to my own parents. I can\u2019t sing in front of them, jokingly, I can\u2019t loosen up and dance when we\u2019re listening to music. Being vocally examined by my teachers in front of the class about lessons I know like the back of my hand, makes my whole body shake, stomach ache, voice tremble and makes me want to throw my guts up. I get scared shitless when my phone rings and it isn\u2019t my mom. I usually just see who\u2019s calling, hang up and text them, because I just can\u2019t talk over the phone. There\u2019s a lot of things I can only say through a text. I stiffen up, blush, my hearts starts to pound whenever someone asks me a question about myself, because I\u2019m so scared they\u2019ll start making fun of my answer. Don\u2019t get me started on having a fight with someone, my heart starts beating so fast, I get all red and flustered and I get immediate diarrhea. When I go out in public by myself, I constantly look around to see if someone\u2019s staring at me and I get so self conscious that they are judging my hair, or my pimples or my eyebrows or the way that I look, or my crooked teeth that they can\u2019t even see, because I\u2019m not smiling. Ever. Cause I\u2019m just so scared. I don\u2019t dress up girly, do my hair or make up, because people are so used seeing me like this, I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say if I change. I\u2019m scared that even with a dress and a face full of make up they are still going to think that I\u2019m ugly. I stop myself mid talking and shut up, because I worry what I had said might have sounded weird. I feel so small and vulnerable when I\u2019m outside by myself, without a group of friends to raise my self esteem. In fact the other day I was in the bus and I gave two coins to the guy for my ticket, he had to give me one back as change, but he forgot and I didn\u2019t say anything to him, even though I needed the coin for another bus and I just ended up walking there. In the kindergarten there was one girl who used to sent her friend to threaten me and beat me up. I was too scared to stand up to her, but even more scared to tell the teacher. This ,, shyness\u201d has made me go through the most awkward moments of my life. Two years ago, I was so scared of people my age that I went out and played with the kids. I was 15 at the time and they were 10. My mom was worried about me, she\u2019d sent me to hang out with a girl from my class, who was also my neighbour, and her best friend. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to them, even though, I\u2019ve grown up with them, so I would just sit down next to them and not say anything. Literally. Not even a ,, hi\u201d. And when they\u2019d get up to go somewhere else, I\u2019d just follow them quietly. That was two years ago, mind you. I was 15. And there\u2019s thousands more examples, I\u2019d need days to count out. Now, I don\u2019t know am I shy, have I spent too much time on tumblr, do I have anxiety, am I just lazy, or fucking weird and damaged, but whatever it is I just want it gone. I\u2019d give up anything to be fixed.\n\nWell, I ain\u2019t no psychologist to tell you.

It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the more likely that their anxious symptoms will be exacerbated.   3 Common Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Intense worrying and often internal questioning about current, future and even past scenarios along with a focus on negative hypothetical outcomes. Example anxious thought: \u201cWhat if my son gets a bike? What if his father doesn\u2019t remind him to wear his new helmet when he rides? What if he falls off the bike, or worse a car comes and hits him? What if he cracks his head open? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t let him get a bike. Should I let him get a bike? It could be dangerous. Maybe I should let him get a bike, I don\u2019t want to be controlling. But what if he really hurts himself on the bike?\u201d   2. Replaying certain memories, thoughts, and\/ or experiences over and over again in their mind, and worrying about them.   Example: \u201cWhy did I say that stupid thing in that meeting? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe they think I\u2019m stupid now? What a stupid thing I said. I should have known better. Will I get another chance to present to the board? What if they don\u2019t give me another chance? What if I lose my job because they think I\u2019m stupid? What if someone was recording the whole meeting? What if they tell other people outside the company? What if I have to start looking for a new job but nobody is hiring? I shouldn\u2019t have said that stupid thing at the meeting.\u201d   3. Physical symptoms and panic attacks:   The more intense anxiety often leads people to have physical symptoms like: increased heart rate, tingling in their hands, difficulty sleeping, pressured speech, and even panic attacks and other issues. In addition, many people with generalized anxiety disorder have an underlying \u201chot thought\u201d or deep underlying worry that they are either going to die or go crazy when they feel extremely anxious (even if they rationally know in their calmer moments that this is not true). Some people who have had panic attacks then become anxious and fixated on the fear that they will have future panic attacks.   The point is\u2026   Most people who suffer from GAD will struggle with frequent negative worrying about present, future, and or past experiences, thoughts, or potential scenarios. The good news is that although anxiety can be very difficult, it is very common and usually treatable with a combination of motivation to improve it, psychotherapy and\/or medications (in the more severe situations).\n\nMany people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or even sub-clinical anxiety that they are faced with on a daily basis.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition  includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder  includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder  involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism  is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder  is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias  are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder  is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder  are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor   See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors \u2014 if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading\n\nMichael K.

Anxiety disorder: My reactions to anxiety causing situations is more severe than most people would experience. I might miss a call and get a voice mail. On bad days, I will be to scared to listen to that voice mail, because I might think the caller was angry at me for not picking up. Yes, seriously.   Panic attacks and panic disorder: Panic attacks feel like you are dying. I start sweating, shaking, my mouth goes dry, I start crying, I get chest pain and it feels like everything is closing in around me. Rational thought goes right out the window. They only last 10-20 minutes, but it feels like an eternity. Panic disorder basically keeps these attacks on replay. You have an attack, then after it's over, you have an intense fear of having the next one. That fear drives you to avoid the situation that triggered the attack, or gets strong enough to trigger another attack. Lather, rinse, repeat. I still have panic attacks, but my panic disorder has been under control for about 4 years.   I also suffer from Adhd, ptsd and possibly Asperger's.   All of this may sound rough, but it's my normal. Most of it is under control. The GAD will always be there. And occasional panic attacks, and ptsd episodes, but I'm dealing with it the best that I can.\n\nIt depends on the anxiety conditions you may have.

Annoying!   A slight delay in your plans? Annoying!   Your partner singing too loud? Annoying!   The delivery guy getting confused with the directions? Annoying!   Basically, you can get easily irritated by almost anything when you are anxious.   2.  The Freeze Mode   Anxiety can freeze you to one stop. You may sit on your bed all day long, stuck in your mind about all the things that could go wrong!   Anxiety escalates overthinking. It forces you to imagine all possible scenarios. I mean, things that are probably never ever going to happen. But your anxious brain will be like, \u201cHey what if\u2026?\u201d   3.  Abandon Everything and Run For The Hills   Anxious people are always on the lookout for dangers. When they perceive even the slightest danger, their inner alarms will go off, promoting them to take immediate action.   Eg: A girl has relationship anxiety. If she detects a slightest change in her boyfriend's tone, her brain will be overcharged with all the possible explanations. Next thing you know she is planning how to break up with her boyfriend.   What I mean here is that people with anxiety generally become impulsive when triggered. Their reaction may not be entirely rational to the situation in hand.   4.  Physical Complaints   Mind and body are strongly connected with each other. When you have high anxiety, it will manifest as physical health issues because that is the only way you will start realising that something is wrong.   Constipation, loose motions, nausea, chest pain, stomach ulcers, frequent cough & cold, body aches, headaches are some of the health issues linked with anxiety.   Being in a state of constant anxiety can f##k up your immune system making you prone to infections, diseases and Illnesses.   I am a personal evidence of that. There was a time when I used to be so anxious that I would hardly eat and whatever I ate, I would puke. Guess what happened? My platelets came crashing down and I caught Tuberculosis.   Always remember that your mind and body are strongly linked with each other. You have to take care of both. Oh, not to forget your soul too \ud83d\udc93   Now, there are many other symptom of anxiety as well. I could quote the DSM-V, but the bottom line is that you need to take holistic care of yourself. Anxiety for whatever reason is not worth it. It ruins your daily life, sense of self, career and relationships. If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety then talk to a trusted friend or even a psychologist.   Prioritize your happiness and health \ud83e\udd70   ~ Your Trusted Therapist\n\nI am a psychologist.

It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

As I said, I\u2019m no proffesional to be sure If I have it or not. People around me don\u2019t believe me, my parents too, so they wouldn\u2019t let me go to a psychologist. I know shy people and I know I feel worse than them in social situations. I know my ,, shyness\u201d doesn\u2019t only come down to being shy in front of strangers or nervous when I talk to a crowd. I\u2019m anxious all the time. Just before I enter my classroom every morning, my stomach clenches. I\u2019m not a new student and I\u2019m not being bullied or scared by any of my classmates. I get shortness of breath before I meet up with my friends. Friends I\u2019ve known for over 10 years. I avoid or get nervous sometimes even when I talk to my own parents. I can\u2019t sing in front of them, jokingly, I can\u2019t loosen up and dance when we\u2019re listening to music. Being vocally examined by my teachers in front of the class about lessons I know like the back of my hand, makes my whole body shake, stomach ache, voice tremble and makes me want to throw my guts up. I get scared shitless when my phone rings and it isn\u2019t my mom. I usually just see who\u2019s calling, hang up and text them, because I just can\u2019t talk over the phone. There\u2019s a lot of things I can only say through a text. I stiffen up, blush, my hearts starts to pound whenever someone asks me a question about myself, because I\u2019m so scared they\u2019ll start making fun of my answer. Don\u2019t get me started on having a fight with someone, my heart starts beating so fast, I get all red and flustered and I get immediate diarrhea. When I go out in public by myself, I constantly look around to see if someone\u2019s staring at me and I get so self conscious that they are judging my hair, or my pimples or my eyebrows or the way that I look, or my crooked teeth that they can\u2019t even see, because I\u2019m not smiling. Ever. Cause I\u2019m just so scared. I don\u2019t dress up girly, do my hair or make up, because people are so used seeing me like this, I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say if I change. I\u2019m scared that even with a dress and a face full of make up they are still going to think that I\u2019m ugly. I stop myself mid talking and shut up, because I worry what I had said might have sounded weird. I feel so small and vulnerable when I\u2019m outside by myself, without a group of friends to raise my self esteem. In fact the other day I was in the bus and I gave two coins to the guy for my ticket, he had to give me one back as change, but he forgot and I didn\u2019t say anything to him, even though I needed the coin for another bus and I just ended up walking there. In the kindergarten there was one girl who used to sent her friend to threaten me and beat me up. I was too scared to stand up to her, but even more scared to tell the teacher. This ,, shyness\u201d has made me go through the most awkward moments of my life. Two years ago, I was so scared of people my age that I went out and played with the kids. I was 15 at the time and they were 10. My mom was worried about me, she\u2019d sent me to hang out with a girl from my class, who was also my neighbour, and her best friend. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to them, even though, I\u2019ve grown up with them, so I would just sit down next to them and not say anything. Literally. Not even a ,, hi\u201d. And when they\u2019d get up to go somewhere else, I\u2019d just follow them quietly. That was two years ago, mind you. I was 15. And there\u2019s thousands more examples, I\u2019d need days to count out. Now, I don\u2019t know am I shy, have I spent too much time on tumblr, do I have anxiety, am I just lazy, or fucking weird and damaged, but whatever it is I just want it gone. I\u2019d give up anything to be fixed.\n\nWell, I ain\u2019t no psychologist to tell you.

Fear is a feeling we are using in order to avoid potential dangers able to harm us (physically or mentally). Fear is meant to keep us safe and help us to avoid dangerous situations.   Anxiety is happening when the fear goes out of control and the mind starts to push the body to react in defensive manners in situations when there is not a real danger or the chances that the situation to become dangerous are minimal.   The first symptoms of anxiety are the sensations of insecurity, then increasing heart rate, sweating, muscle tremor, shortness in breathing, feeling a tight knot in the throat which impedes swallowing, etc.   Feeling anxiety for a short period of time is quite normal, but if ignored and not addressed properly in its causes, the anxiety will slowly grow to panick attacks, then generalised anxiety and chronic anxiety which will eventually lead to depression and some major mental illnesses.   Living with anxiety is troublesome not only for the person who is subjected to it but also for those around. The condition itself is debilitating and is affecting the quality of life of both the subject and the entourage.   Gradually it will turn into real illness, not only mental but physical too since the main organs are overloaded with stimulation and stressed. First to exhibit symptoms are usually the heart and the blood pressure, then the immune system and later one by one all the body organs are starting to function in a stressful manner because they are subjected to abnormal stimulation.   The condition is difficult to understand and cope with by the rest of let\u2019s say \u201cnormal people\u201d and this is why the ones exhibiting it are many times left behind, ignored in their suffering and labeled as \u201cweak\u201d. In fact, those subjected to anxiety are ten times stronger than the rest simply because if exposed to the same \u201cmental overstimulation\u201d, a \u201cnormal person\u201d would break more easily.\n\nAnxiety is an exaggerated manifestation of fear.

Although each person with GAD has their own individual experiences with anxiety , there are certain common symptoms among the majority of people who suffer from this common disorder. It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the more likely that their anxious symptoms will be exacerbated.   3 Common Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Intense worrying and often internal questioning about current, future and even past scenarios along with a focus on negative hypothetical outcomes. Example anxious thought: \u201cWhat if my son gets a bike? What if his father doesn\u2019t remind him to wear his new helmet when he rides? What if he falls off the bike, or worse a car comes and hits him? What if he cracks his head open? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t let him get a bike. Should I let him get a bike? It could be dangerous. Maybe I should let him get a bike, I don\u2019t want to be controlling. But what if he really hurts himself on the bike?\u201d   2. Replaying certain memories, thoughts, and\/ or experiences over and over again in their mind, and worrying about them.   Example: \u201cWhy did I say that stupid thing in that meeting? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe they think I\u2019m stupid now? What a stupid thing I said. I should have known better. Will I get another chance to present to the board? What if they don\u2019t give me another chance? What if I lose my job because they think I\u2019m stupid? What if someone was recording the whole meeting? What if they tell other people outside the company? What if I have to start looking for a new job but nobody is hiring? I shouldn\u2019t have said that stupid thing at the meeting.\u201d   3. Physical symptoms and panic attacks:   The more intense anxiety often leads people to have physical symptoms like: increased heart rate, tingling in their hands, difficulty sleeping, pressured speech, and even panic attacks and other issues. In addition, many people with generalized anxiety disorder have an underlying \u201chot thought\u201d or deep underlying worry that they are either going to die or go crazy when they feel extremely anxious (even if they rationally know in their calmer moments that this is not true). Some people who have had panic attacks then become anxious and fixated on the fear that they will have future panic attacks.   The point is\u2026   Most people who suffer from GAD will struggle with frequent negative worrying about present, future, and or past experiences, thoughts, or potential scenarios. The good news is that although anxiety can be very difficult, it is very common and usually treatable with a combination of motivation to improve it, psychotherapy and\/or medications (in the more severe situations).\n\nMany people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or even sub-clinical anxiety that they are faced with on a daily basis.

For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the mo Continue Reading\n\nMaria-Elisa Vetia Former Syndicated Weekly Columnist NYT (1998\u20132000)  \u00b7  Author has  261  answers and  1.3M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 6y\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading Symptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition  includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder  includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder  involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism  is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder  is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias  are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder  is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder  are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor   See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors \u2014 if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading\n\nDarren Johnson Newspaper Owner and Media Instructor (2010\u2013present)  \u00b7  Author has  8.6K  answers and  18.4M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 7y\n\nI see it manifest in a few ways: A feeling of doom or dread, as if something disproportionately bad is going to happen.

However, when a person regularly feels disproportionate levels of anxiety, it might become a medical disorder.   Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses that lead to excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry   These disorders alter how a person processes emotions and behave, also causing physical symptoms. Mild anxiety might be vague and unsettling, while severe anxiety may seriously affect day-to-day living.It is the most common group of mental illnesses in the country. However, only 36.9% of people with an anxiety disorder receive treatment.   When an individual faces potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival.   Since the earliest days of humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger sets off alarms in the body and allows evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings.   The danger causes a rush of adrenalin, a hormone and chemical messenger in the brain, which in turn triggers these anxious reactions in a process called the \"fight-or-flight' response. This prepares humans to physically confront or flee any potential threats to safety.   For many people, running from larger animals and imminent danger is a less pressing concern than it would have been for early humans. Anxieties now revolve around work, money, family life, health, and other crucial issues that demand a person's attention without necessarily requiring the 'fight-or-flight' reaction.   The nervous feeling before an important life event or during a difficult situation is a natural echo of the original 'fight-or-flight' reaction. It can still be essential to survival \u2013 anxiety about being hit by a car when crossing the street, for example, means that a person will instinctively look both ways to avoid danger.   The duration or severity of an anxious feeling can sometimes be out of proportion to the original trigger, or stressor. Physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and nausea, may also develop. These responses move beyond anxiety into an anxiety disorder.   Symptoms   While a number of different diagnoses constitute anxiety disorders, the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) will often include the following: restlessness, and a feeling of being \"on-edge\" uncontrollable feelings of worry increased irritability concentration difficulties sleep difficulties, such as problems in falling or staying asleep While these symptoms might be normal to experience in daily life, people with GAD will experience them to persistent or extreme levels. GAD may present as vague, unsettling worry or a more severe anxiety that disrupts day-to-day living.   Causes   The causes of anxiety disorders are complicated. Many might occur at once, some may lead to others, and some might not lead to an anxiety disorder unless another is present.   Possible causes include: environmental stressors, such as difficulties at work, relationship problems, or family issues genetics, as people who have family members with an anxiety disorder are more likely to experience one themselves medical factors, such as the symptoms of a different disease, the effects of a medication, or the stress of an intensive surgery or prolonged recovery brain chemistry, as psychologists define many anxiety disorders as misalignments of hormones and electrical signals in the brain withdrawal from an illicit substance, the effects of which might intensify the impact of other possible causes Treatment   Treatments will consist of a combination of psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and medication.   Alcohol dependence, depression, or other conditions can sometimes have such a strong effect on mental well-being that treating an anxiety disorder must wait until any underlying conditions are brought under control.   Self treatment:   In some cases, a person can treat an anxiety disorder at home without clinical supervision. However, this may not be effective for severe or long-term anxiety disorders.   There are several exercises and actions to help a person cope with milder, more focused, or shorter-term anxiety disorders, including: Stress management:  Learning to manage stress can help limit potential triggers. Organize any upcoming pressures and deadlines, compile lists to make daunting tasks more manageable, and commit to taking time off from study or work. Relaxation techniques:  Simple activities can help soothe the mental and physical signs of anxiety. These techniques include meditation, deep breathing exercises, long baths, resting in the dark, and yoga. Exercises to replace negative thoughts with positive ones:  Make a list of the negative thoughts that might be cycling as a result of anxiety, and write down another list next to it containing positive, believable thoughts to replace them. Creating a mental image of successfully facing and conquering a specific fear can also provide benefits if anxiety symptoms relate to a specific cause, such as in a phobia. Support network:  Talk with familiar people who are supportive, such as a family member or friend. Support group services may also be available in the local area and online. Exercise:  Physical exertion can improve self-image and release chemicals in the brain that trigger positive feelings.\n\nAnxiety is a normal and often healthy emotion.

Anxiety is an emotion you feel when under threat as your Sympathetic Nervous System kicks in to prepare for danger. Physically, adrenaline begins pouring through your system, your digestion shuts down, your heart beats faster, your liver releases stored sugar into your bloodstream, you sweat and your pupils dilate.  Anxiety is a vicious circle of thoughts, sensations and behaviors. The origins of an anxious mood lie in your thoughts, some of which you may not even be aware of! These thoughts lead to reactions in the body, causing physical sensations and affecting your behavior. An anxious person tends to think more distressed thoughts, maintaining a vicious circle. Common symptoms of anxiety include: *\u00a0Worrying *\u00a0Lack of self-confidence *\u00a0Self-consciousness *\u00a0Inability to relax *\u00a0Constant feeling of dread *\u00a0Irritable and irrational behavior *\u00a0Loss of concentration *\u00a0Forgetfulness *\u00a0Fear of criticism *\u00a0Nightmares *\u00a0Fear of being alone *\u00a0Fear of being with other people *\u00a0Loss of sexual interest *\u00a0Sleeplessness Challenging anxious thoughts\n \nThe symptoms of anxiety are unpleasant, but they\u2019ll eventually disappear. You can, however, accelerate this process by recognizing and challenging common patterns of anxious thinking. Some of these are: *\u00a0All or nothing attitude\n You think you\u2019re either brilliant at something or terrible at it. If you make a small mistake, you feel you\u2019re a total failure! *\u00a0Making rash generalizations\n You didn\u2019t get on with people at a party once, so you tell yourself \"I never get on with people at parties\". *\u00a0Ignoring the positive\n Dismissing your successes or good qualities, or not even noticing them to begin with. *\u00a0Mind-reading\n Thinking you know what others are or will be thinking about you. *\u00a0Always worrying about the worst-case scenario\n If you have chest pains you worry that you\u2019re having a heart attack or if you've got a headache you worry that you\u2019ve got a brain tumor. How to challenge these thoughts *\u00a0Check if they fall into one of the above patterns. *\u00a0Ask yourself what evidence there is and if there is any to contradict this. *\u00a0Ask yourself what are the realistic chances of the things you dread happening? *\u00a0Reassure yourself that you can cope. Never underestimate your determination, resilience and ability to learn new skills. *\u00a0Try to find a positive thought to replace each anxious one! Calming your physical sensations Essentially you\u2019re trying to stop anxiety symptoms escalating by\nreinforcing your bodies calming mechanisms. Breathing and relaxation are two\nsimple and effective methods, which become even more effective when done\ntogether. Whether you are in an anxious mood, you are likely to be breathing too quickly.\nThis upsets the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, leading to\nunpleasant symptoms of anxiety and panic. Slow down your breathing and aim to breathe 10-12 times per minute. Pause\nbetween breaths and time yourself. You\u2019ll naturally breathe slower through your\nnose rather than your mouth. Try to exhale for as long as you inhale. Anxious breathing tends to push out the chest only. Instead breathe from your\ndiaphragm, steadily taking air right down into the bottom of your lungs and\npushing your stomach out. Breathing exercises *\u00a0Put one hand on your chest and the other between your breastbone and belly-button. Take 10-15 slow deep breaths and try to get your stomach moving in and out whilst keeping your chest still (this takes practice!) *\u00a0Once you can do this, you can do \u20183-6-9\u2019 breaths. Imagine each your lungs as three-floored buildings that are going to fill with air. Breathe in to 3 filling the top floor, into 6 filling the middle and to 9 filling the ground floor. Now breathe out, imagining you are emptying first the top floor (9,8,7) then the middle floor (6,5,4) and finally the ground floor (3,2,1). Repeat this 5 times. *\u00a0Sit or lie down. Relax all parts of your body as much as possible. Take 10 steady breaths, count upwards and say \u201crelax\u201d or \u201ccalming down\u201d to yourself each time you breathe out. When you get to 10, count back down and repeat. Relaxation exercises Twenty minutes to half an hour of progressive muscular relaxation every day is a great way to reduce anxiety and stress. It is body based and uses your breathing, so it can really absorb your attention (giving your mind a rest). 1.\u00a0Sit or lie down somewhere warm and comfortable (where you will not be disturbed). 2.\u00a0Let your breathing settle into a slow rhythm. Be aware of your tummy rising and falling, but don\u2019t make an effort to breathe deeply (when you\u2019re relaxed you naturally take shallow breaths). 3.\u00a0Tense and relax parts of your body in tune with your breathing. Breathe in and tense muscles and relax them when you exhale. Practice this using a clenched fist to start with. Keep your breathing regular and try not to hold your breath! 4.\u00a0Apply this to the rest of your body, starting with feet and calf muscles, moving to general leg muscles (throughout the legs), onto buttocks and groin, stomach, shoulders (hunch up to your ears), arms, hands and face. Repeat each tense-and-relax at least twice. 5.\u00a0Spot-check your body for parts that are not relaxed and do them again. In particular check your stomach, neck, shoulders, and face. 6.\u00a0When you\u2019re feeling completely floppy and heavy, keep your breathing steady. Enjoy feeling at peace and completely relaxed. Tips *\u00a0Practice improves your ability to relax. *\u00a0Don\u2019t worry about overlap between different body parts. It\u2019s impossible to clench your buttocks without your thighs, for example. *\u00a0It may help to say things while breathing out, like \u201crelax\u201d or \u201cexhale\u201d. *\u00a0When you relax your face, check your forehead, jaw, eyelids, lips and tongue for tension.\n Soft calming background music helps your brain get the message. Do these exercises a few times each day, until your breathing patterns change. Then put the breathing and relaxation exercises together. Your thoughts will distract you at first, but persevere and your concentration will improve. If you do this twice per day, you should notice an overall reduction in anxiety levels within a week or two. Challenging your behavior Here is a list of behaviors linked to anxiety *\u00a0Drinking alcohol *\u00a0Pacing\/fidgeting *\u00a0Lack of exercise *\u00a0Smoking cigarettes *\u00a0Driving aggressively *\u00a0Avoiding people or situations *\u00a0Spending too much money *\u00a0Drinking too much caffeine *\u00a0Working long hours *\u00a0Bottling up feelings *\u00a0Taking drugs *\u00a0Irregular eating patterns *\u00a0Biting your nails Do you recognize yourself in this list? Lots of people do these things every day! If this applies to you, take some constructive steps, starting with things you already believe you can succeed at. Anxious people can be de-stressed by: A healthier lifestyle *\u00a0Eat regular meals, including breakfast (even if it\u2019s only a banana), to keep blood sugar levels steady.\n Avoid junk food and sugary or fatty snacks. *\u00a0Limit your alcohol and caffeine intake. *\u00a0Reduce or stop smoking (it feels calming but physically it causes your body stress). *\u00a0Maintain a balance of work, rest and play. *\u00a0Try to keep regular sleeping hours. *\u00a0Build 20-30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine, even if it\u2019s just walking around the block. Time and Resource Management *\u00a0Plan ahead and prioritize by allocating time for both work and recreation. *\u00a0Don\u2019t procrastinate and then leave yourself in a mad rush to meet a deadline. - Be realistic about time and try to finish one thing before moving on. *\u00a0Live according to your means because big debts are anxiety-provoking (credit cards particularly). Emotional Support and Release *\u00a0Don\u2019t bottle up your feelings. Pent-up emotions feed anxiety. *\u00a0Talk to friends, family, a counselor or someone else you trust. *\u00a0Try to let yourself cry if you want to. *\u00a0If you\u2019re angry but there\u2019s no one to vent to, find a non-harmful way to relieve the stress. Some people shut themselves in their car for a good scream. Others lift weights, beat up their bed or smash eggs in the bath! Facing up to difficult situations If your anxiety is tied to particular situations (such as giving presentations), the only way you can learn to deal with these is to face them. If you avoid them because you\u2019re anxious, you\u2019ll feel even worse about it next time. Build up to the situation by imagining it. If you notice yourself feeling anxious, pause and do some breathing exercises and physical relaxation. Unfold the scenario and imagine yourself coping with the fear and getting through successfully. If necessary you can do these in public without people noticing.

Relax all parts of your body as much as possible. Take 10 steady breaths, count upwards and say \u201crelax\u201d or \u201ccalming down\u201d to yourself each time you breathe out. When you get to 10, count back down and repeat. Relaxation exercises Twenty minutes to half an hour of progressive muscular relaxation every day is a great way to reduce anxiety and stress. It is body based and uses your breathing, so it can really absorb your attention (giving your mind a rest). 1.\u00a0Sit or lie down somewhere warm and comfortable (where you will not be disturbed). 2.\u00a0Let your breathing settle into a slow rhythm. Be aware of your tummy rising and falling, but don\u2019t make an effort to breathe deeply (when you\u2019re relaxed you naturally take shallow breaths). 3.\u00a0Tense and relax parts of your body in tune with your breathing. Breathe in and tense muscles and relax them when you exhale. Practice this using a clenched fist to start with. Keep your breathing regular and try not to hold your breath! 4.\u00a0Apply this to the rest of your body, starting with feet and calf muscles, moving to general leg muscles (throughout the legs), onto buttocks and groin, stomach, shoulders (hunch up to your ears), arms, hands and face. Repeat each tense-and-relax at least twice. 5.\u00a0Spot-check your body for parts that are not relaxed and do them again. In particular check your stomach, neck, shoulders, and face. 6.\u00a0When you\u2019re feeling completely floppy and heavy, keep your breathing steady. Enjoy feeling at peace and completely relaxed. Tips *\u00a0Practice improves your ability to relax. *\u00a0Don\u2019t worry about overlap between different body parts. It\u2019s impossible to clench your buttocks without your thighs, for example. *\u00a0It may help to say things while breathing out, like \u201crelax\u201d or \u201cexhale\u201d. *\u00a0When you relax your face, check your forehead, jaw, eyelids, lips and tongue for tension.\n Soft calming background music helps your brain get the message. Do these exercises a few times each day, until your breathing patterns change. Then put the breathing and relaxation exercises together. Your thoughts will distract you at first, but persevere and your concentration will improve. If you do this twice per day, you should notice an overall reduction in anxiety levels within a week or two. Challenging your behavior Here is a list of behaviors linked to anxiety *\u00a0Drinking alcohol *\u00a0Pacing\/fidgeting *\u00a0Lack of exercise *\u00a0Smoking cigarettes *\u00a0Driving aggressively *\u00a0Avoiding people or situations *\u00a0Spending too much money *\u00a0Drinking too much caffeine *\u00a0Working long hours *\u00a0Bottling up feelings *\u00a0Taking drugs *\u00a0Irregular eating patterns *\u00a0Biting your nails Do you recognize yourself in this list? Lots of people do these things every day! If this applies to you, take some constructive steps, starting with things you already believe you can succeed at. Anxious people can be de-stressed by: A healthier lifestyle *\u00a0Eat regular meals, including breakfast (even if it\u2019s only a banana), to keep blood sugar levels steady.\n Avoid junk food and sugary or fatty snacks. *\u00a0Limit your alcohol and caffeine intake. *\u00a0Reduce or stop smoking (it feels calming but physically it causes your body stress). *\u00a0Maintain a balance of work, rest and play. *\u00a0Try to keep regular sleeping hours. *\u00a0Build 20-30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine, even if it\u2019s just walking around the block. Time and Resource Management *\u00a0Plan ahead and prioritize by allocating time for both work and recreation. *\u00a0Don\u2019t procrastinate and then leave yourself in a mad rush to meet a deadline. - Be realistic about time and try to finish one thing before moving on. *\u00a0Live according to your means because big debts are anxiety-provoking (credit cards particularly). Emotional Support and Release *\u00a0Don\u2019t bottle up your feelings. Pent-up emotions feed anxiety. *\u00a0Talk to friends, family, a counselor or someone else you trust. *\u00a0Try to let yourself cry if you want to. *\u00a0If you\u2019re angry but there\u2019s no one to vent to, find a non-harmful way to relieve the stress. Some people shut themselves in their car for a good scream. Others lift weights, beat up their bed or smash eggs in the bath! Facing up to difficult situations If your anxiety is tied to particular situations (such as giving presentations), the only way you can learn to deal with these is to face them. If you avoid them because you\u2019re anxious, you\u2019ll feel even worse about it next time. Build up to the situation by imagining it. If you notice yourself feeling anxious, pause and do some breathing exercises and physical relaxation. Unfold the scenario and imagine yourself coping with the fear and getting through successfully. If necessary you can do these in public without people noticing.

This triggers the nervous system's fight or flight response and motivates us to deal with a stressful or threatening situation. During our hunter-gathering days, anxiety would ward us of danger and keep us alert. Nowadays we don't depend on it in this manner but we have yet to evolve fully from it.

During our hunter-gathering days, anxiety would ward us of danger and keep us alert. Nowadays we don't depend on it in this manner but we have yet to evolve fully from it.   Due to the stresses of modern society and the expectations put upon us, many of us have a hard time dealing with this stress and develop emotional and chemical imbalances. Anxiety becomes an illness when it is present, even during times where there is no threat. This can cause one to lose focus and act irrationally, develop phobias, become nervous, panicky or overexcited and restless\/hyperactive, fidgety, socially awkward, agitated, worrying or overwhelmed. It can cause other illnesses to develop and wreak havoc on one's self-esteem and well-being if it gets severe. Because of its nature of origin, anxiety occurs when we are no longer living in the present moment because it is our motivator to escape that particular environment.   In order to treat this illness we have to work on relaxing our mind and bringing it back into the present moment. This could mean taking a moment to observe and take in surroundings, focusing on our breathing and senses, listening to relaxing music or focusing on a healthy distraction such as reading a book or going for a walk in nature\u2014 generally doing things that feed the soul.   By calming the mind, we calm our emotional state and can look at things more rationally and appreciate the moment much more. If our emotional state is clouding our judgement, it can intensify the anxiety. We must first acknowledge the anxiety and embrace it rather than try to fight it. Being in a rational frame of mind, we can quickly determine whether or not we are actually under threat and reassure our mind. (A little anxiety is healthy and necessary for productivity, but too much impacts our focus).   If we're in a distracting environment where we can't relax and we can't avoid it, we have to tell our mind that this is only temporary otherwise it will keep trying to push us to flee. If we're in an environment that is too overwhelming then our health should be priority and we should go somewhere quieter where we can collect our thoughts and relax so that we gain focus again. Accepting the anxiety and not worrying what others think can really help overcome the intensity.   By taking back control of one's own life, choosing our own path and going at a pace that is comfortable for us rather than what is dictated socially, we immediately relinquish worry and stress and this will reduce the anxiety.\n\nAnxiety is a necessary emotion that is triggered by the release of a hormone known as serotonin.

It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

Annoying!   A slight delay in your plans? Annoying!   Your partner singing too loud? Annoying!   The delivery guy getting confused with the directions? Annoying!   Basically, you can get easily irritated by almost anything when you are anxious.   2.  The Freeze Mode   Anxiety can freeze you to one stop. You may sit on your bed all day long, stuck in your mind about all the things that could go wrong!   Anxiety escalates overthinking. It forces you to imagine all possible scenarios. I mean, things that are probably never ever going to happen. But your anxious brain will be like, \u201cHey what if\u2026?\u201d   3.  Abandon Everything and Run For The Hills   Anxious people are always on the lookout for dangers. When they perceive even the slightest danger, their inner alarms will go off, promoting them to take immediate action.   Eg: A girl has relationship anxiety. If she detects a slightest change in her boyfriend's tone, her brain will be overcharged with all the possible explanations. Next thing you know she is planning how to break up with her boyfriend.   What I mean here is that people with anxiety generally become impulsive when triggered. Their reaction may not be entirely rational to the situation in hand.   4.  Physical Complaints   Mind and body are strongly connected with each other. When you have high anxiety, it will manifest as physical health issues because that is the only way you will start realising that something is wrong.   Constipation, loose motions, nausea, chest pain, stomach ulcers, frequent cough & cold, body aches, headaches are some of the health issues linked with anxiety.   Being in a state of constant anxiety can f##k up your immune system making you prone to infections, diseases and Illnesses.   I am a personal evidence of that. There was a time when I used to be so anxious that I would hardly eat and whatever I ate, I would puke. Guess what happened? My platelets came crashing down and I caught Tuberculosis.   Always remember that your mind and body are strongly linked with each other. You have to take care of both. Oh, not to forget your soul too \ud83d\udc93   Now, there are many other symptom of anxiety as well. I could quote the DSM-V, but the bottom line is that you need to take holistic care of yourself. Anxiety for whatever reason is not worth it. It ruins your daily life, sense of self, career and relationships. If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety then talk to a trusted friend or even a psychologist.   Prioritize your happiness and health \ud83e\udd70   ~ Your Trusted Therapist\n\nI am a psychologist.

As I said, I\u2019m no proffesional to be sure If I have it or not. People around me don\u2019t believe me, my parents too, so they wouldn\u2019t let me go to a psychologist. I know shy people and I know I feel worse than them in social situations. I know my ,, shyness\u201d doesn\u2019t only come down to being shy in front of strangers or nervous when I talk to a crowd. I\u2019m anxious all the time. Just before I enter my classroom every morning, my stomach clenches. I\u2019m not a new student and I\u2019m not being bullied or scared by any of my classmates. I get shortness of breath before I meet up with my friends. Friends I\u2019ve known for over 10 years. I avoid or get nervous sometimes even when I talk to my own parents. I can\u2019t sing in front of them, jokingly, I can\u2019t loosen up and dance when we\u2019re listening to music. Being vocally examined by my teachers in front of the class about lessons I know like the back of my hand, makes my whole body shake, stomach ache, voice tremble and makes me want to throw my guts up. I get scared shitless when my phone rings and it isn\u2019t my mom. I usually just see who\u2019s calling, hang up and text them, because I just can\u2019t talk over the phone. There\u2019s a lot of things I can only say through a text. I stiffen up, blush, my hearts starts to pound whenever someone asks me a question about myself, because I\u2019m so scared they\u2019ll start making fun of my answer. Don\u2019t get me started on having a fight with someone, my heart starts beating so fast, I get all red and flustered and I get immediate diarrhea. When I go out in public by myself, I constantly look around to see if someone\u2019s staring at me and I get so self conscious that they are judging my hair, or my pimples or my eyebrows or the way that I look, or my crooked teeth that they can\u2019t even see, because I\u2019m not smiling. Ever. Cause I\u2019m just so scared. I don\u2019t dress up girly, do my hair or make up, because people are so used seeing me like this, I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say if I change. I\u2019m scared that even with a dress and a face full of make up they are still going to think that I\u2019m ugly. I stop myself mid talking and shut up, because I worry what I had said might have sounded weird. I feel so small and vulnerable when I\u2019m outside by myself, without a group of friends to raise my self esteem. In fact the other day I was in the bus and I gave two coins to the guy for my ticket, he had to give me one back as change, but he forgot and I didn\u2019t say anything to him, even though I needed the coin for another bus and I just ended up walking there. In the kindergarten there was one girl who used to sent her friend to threaten me and beat me up. I was too scared to stand up to her, but even more scared to tell the teacher. This ,, shyness\u201d has made me go through the most awkward moments of my life. Two years ago, I was so scared of people my age that I went out and played with the kids. I was 15 at the time and they were 10. My mom was worried about me, she\u2019d sent me to hang out with a girl from my class, who was also my neighbour, and her best friend. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to them, even though, I\u2019ve grown up with them, so I would just sit down next to them and not say anything. Literally. Not even a ,, hi\u201d. And when they\u2019d get up to go somewhere else, I\u2019d just follow them quietly. That was two years ago, mind you. I was 15. And there\u2019s thousands more examples, I\u2019d need days to count out. Now, I don\u2019t know am I shy, have I spent too much time on tumblr, do I have anxiety, am I just lazy, or fucking weird and damaged, but whatever it is I just want it gone. I\u2019d give up anything to be fixed.\n\nWell, I ain\u2019t no psychologist to tell you.

Fear is a feeling we are using in order to avoid potential dangers able to harm us (physically or mentally). Fear is meant to keep us safe and help us to avoid dangerous situations.   Anxiety is happening when the fear goes out of control and the mind starts to push the body to react in defensive manners in situations when there is not a real danger or the chances that the situation to become dangerous are minimal.   The first symptoms of anxiety are the sensations of insecurity, then increasing heart rate, sweating, muscle tremor, shortness in breathing, feeling a tight knot in the throat which impedes swallowing, etc.   Feeling anxiety for a short period of time is quite normal, but if ignored and not addressed properly in its causes, the anxiety will slowly grow to panick attacks, then generalised anxiety and chronic anxiety which will eventually lead to depression and some major mental illnesses.   Living with anxiety is troublesome not only for the person who is subjected to it but also for those around. The condition itself is debilitating and is affecting the quality of life of both the subject and the entourage.   Gradually it will turn into real illness, not only mental but physical too since the main organs are overloaded with stimulation and stressed. First to exhibit symptoms are usually the heart and the blood pressure, then the immune system and later one by one all the body organs are starting to function in a stressful manner because they are subjected to abnormal stimulation.   The condition is difficult to understand and cope with by the rest of let\u2019s say \u201cnormal people\u201d and this is why the ones exhibiting it are many times left behind, ignored in their suffering and labeled as \u201cweak\u201d. In fact, those subjected to anxiety are ten times stronger than the rest simply because if exposed to the same \u201cmental overstimulation\u201d, a \u201cnormal person\u201d would break more easily.\n\nAnxiety is an exaggerated manifestation of fear.

Although each person with GAD has their own individual experiences with anxiety , there are certain common symptoms among the majority of people who suffer from this common disorder. It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the more likely that their anxious symptoms will be exacerbated.   3 Common Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Intense worrying and often internal questioning about current, future and even past scenarios along with a focus on negative hypothetical outcomes. Example anxious thought: \u201cWhat if my son gets a bike? What if his father doesn\u2019t remind him to wear his new helmet when he rides? What if he falls off the bike, or worse a car comes and hits him? What if he cracks his head open? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t let him get a bike. Should I let him get a bike? It could be dangerous. Maybe I should let him get a bike, I don\u2019t want to be controlling. But what if he really hurts himself on the bike?\u201d   2. Replaying certain memories, thoughts, and\/ or experiences over and over again in their mind, and worrying about them.   Example: \u201cWhy did I say that stupid thing in that meeting? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe they think I\u2019m stupid now? What a stupid thing I said. I should have known better. Will I get another chance to present to the board? What if they don\u2019t give me another chance? What if I lose my job because they think I\u2019m stupid? What if someone was recording the whole meeting? What if they tell other people outside the company? What if I have to start looking for a new job but nobody is hiring? I shouldn\u2019t have said that stupid thing at the meeting.\u201d   3. Physical symptoms and panic attacks:   The more intense anxiety often leads people to have physical symptoms like: increased heart rate, tingling in their hands, difficulty sleeping, pressured speech, and even panic attacks and other issues. In addition, many people with generalized anxiety disorder have an underlying \u201chot thought\u201d or deep underlying worry that they are either going to die or go crazy when they feel extremely anxious (even if they rationally know in their calmer moments that this is not true). Some people who have had panic attacks then become anxious and fixated on the fear that they will have future panic attacks.   The point is\u2026   Most people who suffer from GAD will struggle with frequent negative worrying about present, future, and or past experiences, thoughts, or potential scenarios. The good news is that although anxiety can be very difficult, it is very common and usually treatable with a combination of motivation to improve it, psychotherapy and\/or medications (in the more severe situations).\n\nMany people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or even sub-clinical anxiety that they are faced with on a daily basis. Although each person with GAD has their own individual experiences with anxiety , there are certain common symptoms among the majority of people who suffer from this common disorder. It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the mo Continue Reading\n\nMaria-Elisa Vetia Former Syndicated Weekly Columnist NYT (1998\u20132000)  \u00b7  Author has  261  answers and  1.3M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 6y\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading Symptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition  includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder  includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder  involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism  is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder  is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias  are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder  is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder  are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor   See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors \u2014 if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading\n\nI feel like a wave is hitting me because my chest will tighten and heart starts beating fast and then I start to have restless legs, arms I have to keep moving them.

And for all the non- psychology students, if there is a cause behind your anxiety\u2026it's not a disorder anymore. These types of normal anxieties ultimately get over if the cause gets over .   Anxiety disorder is known as GAD(Generalized Anxiety Disorder). These patients feel anxiety Everytime , even if everything is fine.   Symptoms- Rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, Loss of appetite, Weight loss, Excessive sweating, Palpitations (Palm sweating), High B.P. , Dizziness, Sleeplessness, Restlessness, Diarrhoea, Frequent urination.   Causes of G.A.D. - 1. Biological problems i.e problem in blood chemistry, hormones & neurotransmitter & also due to high secretion of thyroxine in blood asymilation.   2. Socio- cultural problems i.e. discrimination, unemployment due to corruption, child marriage, widow problems, etc. For instance, there is a widow from a somewhat narrow section of society . She is bound to follow society's so-called norms of not laughing loudly, not going out shopping,etc. But one day her children asked her very pleadingly to take them out for a movie as they really want to enjoy the movie time as their friends do. So due to her children's happiness she went out for a movie. Society's \u201cruling aunties\u201d saw her & started giving her bad names. She came home crying but wondered how her life would be if she were not a widow & enjoyed her life like anything. She slowly started generating a second personality of her own which is very cheerful & she then compares her original personality with the fake one & this comparison at every step develops the cause for anxiety.   Treatment- 1. Psychodynamic therapy is the one in which the client's unconscious memory is brought into conscious one by making him recall his history or past events.   2. Medicines are required especially seductives(to suppress the activity) & tranquilizers (to activate the task).   3. Cognitive Behavioral therapy- To correct a person's cognition, thinking or behavior.   4. Counselling of patient as well as his family members.   Note- 100% curable .\n\nAnxiety is the most common neurotic disorder & being a student of psychology I can explain in a better way.

However, this answer is not based only on my years of studying mental health, but also on my personal battle with anxiety.   As a child, when I had anxiety it would manifest as digestive issues or stomach aches. These are the physical symptoms of anxiety. Even today when I am anxious about a big interview or some important matter, I keep running to the loo.   Here are some other signs of anxiety that you can watch out for: Don\u2019t Even Breathe Around Me! Little things annoy you. You get easily irritated.   Your neighbour with their usual morning chat? Annoying!   A slight delay in your plans? Annoying!   Your partner singing too loud? Annoying!   The delivery guy getting confused with the directions? Annoying!   Basically, you can get easily irritated by almost anything when you are anxious.   2.  The Freeze Mode   Anxiety can freeze you to one stop. You may sit on your bed all day long, stuck in your mind about all the things that could go wrong!   Anxiety escalates overthinking. It forces you to imagine all possible scenarios. I mean, things that are probably never ever going to happen. But your anxious brain will be like, \u201cHey what if\u2026?\u201d   3.  Abandon Everything and Run For The Hills   Anxious people are always on the lookout for dangers. When they perceive even the slightest danger, their inner alarms will go off, promoting them to take immediate action.   Eg: A girl has relationship anxiety. If she detects a slightest change in her boyfriend's tone, her brain will be overcharged with all the possible explanations. Next thing you know she is planning how to break up with her boyfriend.   What I mean here is that people with anxiety generally become impulsive when triggered. Their reaction may not be entirely rational to the situation in hand.   4.  Physical Complaints   Mind and body are strongly connected with each other. When you have high anxiety, it will manifest as physical health issues because that is the only way you will start realising that something is wrong.   Constipation, loose motions, nausea, chest pain, stomach ulcers, frequent cough & cold, body aches, headaches are some of the health issues linked with anxiety.   Being in a state of constant anxiety can f##k up your immune system making you prone to infections, diseases and Illnesses.   I am a personal evidence of that. There was a time when I used to be so anxious that I would hardly eat and whatever I ate, I would puke. Guess what happened? My platelets came crashing down and I caught Tuberculosis.   Always remember that your mind and body are strongly linked with each other. You have to take care of both. Oh, not to forget your soul too \ud83d\udc93   Now, there are many other symptom of anxiety as well. I could quote the DSM-V, but the bottom line is that you need to take holistic care of yourself. Anxiety for whatever reason is not worth it. It ruins your daily life, sense of self, career and relationships. If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety then talk to a trusted friend or even a psychologist.   Prioritize your happiness and health \ud83e\udd70   ~ Your Trusted Therapist\n\nI am a psychologist.

I want to share a deeply personal story about my mental health journey and how Manastha has been a constant source of support and healing for me.   My first experience with Manastha dates back to 2020, when the world was turned upside down by the pandemic. Like many, I found myself battling anxiety and stress that began affecting my physical health. I knew it was time to reach out for help again.   When I needed therapy recently, my previous therapist wasn\u2019t available due to vacation. Manastha quickly assigned me a new, well-trained psychologist, and what amazed me the most was how effortlessly they passed on my case history. I didn\u2019t have to go through the emotional strain of retelling my story. The transition was smooth, compassionate, and thoughtful. I felt heard, understood, and cared for.   Every experience I\u2019ve had with Manastha has left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and less alone in my journey. And I want to share why Manastha might be the right choice for you too.   Why Manastha Stands Out:   1.  Affordable, Transparent Pricing : No hidden costs, just genuine care.   2.  Immediate Support within 60 Minutes : You can be connected with a therapist in as little as 60 minutes \u2013 because your mental health matters now, not later.   3.  Real, Uninterrupted Sessions : A full 60-minute session means ample time to explore, express, and heal \u2013 unlike some services that cut corners with shorter sessions.   4.  Expert Care  from  AIIMS  &  NIMHANS  Professionals: Manastha offers access to some of the most respected mental health experts in the country, ensuring you receive top-notch support.   5.  Professional  and  Compassionate Team : They don\u2019t just offer therapy; they build relationships. The extra sessions and extended validity they offered me when I needed it most were gestures of genuine kindness.   6.  Trusted by Global Leaders : There\u2019s a reason why top companies like  SAMSUNG ,  HCL ,  WIPRO ,  AMITY ,  TITAN , etc trust Manastha for their Employee Assistance Programs. Manastha\u2019s reputation for professionalism and client satisfaction is unmatched.   A few months ago, I decided to return to therapy, and I was amazed when they reconnected me with my previous therapist. It felt like reconnecting with an old friend who already knew my journey and was ready to help me continue it.   Manastha also have psychiatric services with experts from AIIMS and NIMHANS, and I\u2019m currently benefiting from that as well. Their commitment to comprehensive mental health care is truly remarkable.   If you\u2019ve been struggling silently, please know that help is just one step away. I\u2019m here to answer any questions you may have, so feel free to reach out.   We deserve healing. We deserve support. And we deserve to feel whole again.\n\nMANASTHA ONLINE COUNSELING: A Journey to Healing and Self-Discovery   Hello everyone,   I\u2019m  Surbhi , originally from India but currently living in Sweden.

It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

As I said, I\u2019m no proffesional to be sure If I have it or not. People around me don\u2019t believe me, my parents too, so they wouldn\u2019t let me go to a psychologist. I know shy people and I know I feel worse than them in social situations. I know my ,, shyness\u201d doesn\u2019t only come down to being shy in front of strangers or nervous when I talk to a crowd. I\u2019m anxious all the time. Just before I enter my classroom every morning, my stomach clenches. I\u2019m not a new student and I\u2019m not being bullied or scared by any of my classmates. I get shortness of breath before I meet up with my friends. Friends I\u2019ve known for over 10 years. I avoid or get nervous sometimes even when I talk to my own parents. I can\u2019t sing in front of them, jokingly, I can\u2019t loosen up and dance when we\u2019re listening to music. Being vocally examined by my teachers in front of the class about lessons I know like the back of my hand, makes my whole body shake, stomach ache, voice tremble and makes me want to throw my guts up. I get scared shitless when my phone rings and it isn\u2019t my mom. I usually just see who\u2019s calling, hang up and text them, because I just can\u2019t talk over the phone. There\u2019s a lot of things I can only say through a text. I stiffen up, blush, my hearts starts to pound whenever someone asks me a question about myself, because I\u2019m so scared they\u2019ll start making fun of my answer. Don\u2019t get me started on having a fight with someone, my heart starts beating so fast, I get all red and flustered and I get immediate diarrhea. When I go out in public by myself, I constantly look around to see if someone\u2019s staring at me and I get so self conscious that they are judging my hair, or my pimples or my eyebrows or the way that I look, or my crooked teeth that they can\u2019t even see, because I\u2019m not smiling. Ever. Cause I\u2019m just so scared. I don\u2019t dress up girly, do my hair or make up, because people are so used seeing me like this, I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say if I change. I\u2019m scared that even with a dress and a face full of make up they are still going to think that I\u2019m ugly. I stop myself mid talking and shut up, because I worry what I had said might have sounded weird. I feel so small and vulnerable when I\u2019m outside by myself, without a group of friends to raise my self esteem. In fact the other day I was in the bus and I gave two coins to the guy for my ticket, he had to give me one back as change, but he forgot and I didn\u2019t say anything to him, even though I needed the coin for another bus and I just ended up walking there. In the kindergarten there was one girl who used to sent her friend to threaten me and beat me up. I was too scared to stand up to her, but even more scared to tell the teacher. This ,, shyness\u201d has made me go through the most awkward moments of my life. Two years ago, I was so scared of people my age that I went out and played with the kids. I was 15 at the time and they were 10. My mom was worried about me, she\u2019d sent me to hang out with a girl from my class, who was also my neighbour, and her best friend. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to them, even though, I\u2019ve grown up with them, so I would just sit down next to them and not say anything. Literally. Not even a ,, hi\u201d. And when they\u2019d get up to go somewhere else, I\u2019d just follow them quietly. That was two years ago, mind you. I was 15. And there\u2019s thousands more examples, I\u2019d need days to count out. Now, I don\u2019t know am I shy, have I spent too much time on tumblr, do I have anxiety, am I just lazy, or fucking weird and damaged, but whatever it is I just want it gone. I\u2019d give up anything to be fixed.\n\nWell, I ain\u2019t no psychologist to tell you. In fact I was begging my parents to take me to a therapist, so they could tell me if I even have anxiety in the first place or I\u2019m just being overdramatic. Now I know they probably can\u2019t diagnose you with a snap of their fingers, but I was desperate. I still am. People tell me - ,, no, you don\u2019t have anxiety, you\u2019re just shy and you want attention and to be different so bad, that you self diagnose with mental illnesses, that you don\u2019t have, because it\u2019s trendy.\u201d I\u2019m sure a lot of people with actual mental ilnesses have heard that, as well as people th Continue Reading\n\nOkay, so I'm sure you've read the list of anxiety symptoms on Google so I'm going to skip that and list some examples.

I'm so alone and it's my own fault.\u201d Or say you do end up going, and you criticise your every move. Your too scared to speak in case you say something wrong. Then you're scared you're being too quiet and they think you're being rude or are bored of them. Rinse and repeat everytime there is a social gathering. You have a test coming up and it's on your mind 24\/7. You constantly feel like you should be studying for it, and you feel guilty for doing anything else. Whenever you sit down to study you feel overwhelmed, like no matter how much you study or how hard you try, you will never be good enough. So you put off studying, but it still weighs heavy on your mind. You're not avoiding studying because you're lazy or unmotivated, it's because everytime you try to study you are hit with intense feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness. It's 6:34pm, your partner is usually home by 6:30pm. You begin to panic and your head starts to fill with horrible scenarios. \u201cWhat if they were in a car accident? What if they were kidnapped? What if they have decided to leave me and I never see them again? Will the last time we spoke be the last time I ever talk to them?\u201d 6:41pm they walk through the door, they were late because they got caught up in a conversation with their boss. Those 7 minutes felt like an hour, as you genuinely believed your loved one might have been hurt or even dead. You saw your whole future crumble in front of you, for no rational reason. But hey, at least they're safe. Thanks for reading, best wishes \ud83d\udc99\n\nOkay, so I'm sure you've read the list of anxiety symptoms on Google so I'm going to skip that and list some examples.

Although each person with GAD has their own individual experiences with anxiety , there are certain common symptoms among the majority of people who suffer from this common disorder.

Although each person with GAD has their own individual experiences with anxiety , there are certain common symptoms among the majority of people who suffer from this common disorder. It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the more likely that their anxious symptoms will be exacerbated.   3 Common Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Intense worrying and often internal questioning about current, future and even past scenarios along with a focus on negative hypothetical outcomes. Example anxious thought: \u201cWhat if my son gets a bike? What if his father doesn\u2019t remind him to wear his new helmet when he rides? What if he falls off the bike, or worse a car comes and hits him? What if he cracks his head open? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t let him get a bike. Should I let him get a bike? It could be dangerous. Maybe I should let him get a bike, I don\u2019t want to be controlling. But what if he really hurts himself on the bike?\u201d   2. Replaying certain memories, thoughts, and\/ or experiences over and over again in their mind, and worrying about them.   Example: \u201cWhy did I say that stupid thing in that meeting? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe they think I\u2019m stupid now? What a stupid thing I said. I should have known better. Will I get another chance to present to the board? What if they don\u2019t give me another chance? What if I lose my job because they think I\u2019m stupid? What if someone was recording the whole meeting? What if they tell other people outside the company? What if I have to start looking for a new job but nobody is hiring? I shouldn\u2019t have said that stupid thing at the meeting.\u201d   3. Physical symptoms and panic attacks:   The more intense anxiety often leads people to have physical symptoms like: increased heart rate, tingling in their hands, difficulty sleeping, pressured speech, and even panic attacks and other issues. In addition, many people with generalized anxiety disorder have an underlying \u201chot thought\u201d or deep underlying worry that they are either going to die or go crazy when they feel extremely anxious (even if they rationally know in their calmer moments that this is not true). Some people who have had panic attacks then become anxious and fixated on the fear that they will have future panic attacks.   The point is\u2026   Most people who suffer from GAD will struggle with frequent negative worrying about present, future, and or past experiences, thoughts, or potential scenarios. The good news is that although anxiety can be very difficult, it is very common and usually treatable with a combination of motivation to improve it, psychotherapy and\/or medications (in the more severe situations).\n\nMany people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or even sub-clinical anxiety that they are faced with on a daily basis.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition  includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder  includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder  involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism  is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder  is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias  are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder  is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder  are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor   See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors \u2014 if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.\n\nSymptoms   Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: Agoraphobia  (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often  Continue Reading\n\nThe cycle of anxiety typically begins with a situation brining on uncomfortable feelings and symptoms.

Fear is a feeling we are using in order to avoid potential dangers able to harm us (physically or mentally). Fear is meant to keep us safe and help us to avoid dangerous situations.   Anxiety is happening when the fear goes out of control and the mind starts to push the body to react in defensive manners in situations when there is not a real danger or the chances that the situation to become dangerous are minimal.

Anxiety is happening when the fear goes out of control and the mind starts to push the body to react in defensive manners in situations when there is not a real danger or the chances that the situation to become dangerous are minimal.   The first symptoms of anxiety are the sensations of insecurity, then increasing heart rate, sweating, muscle tremor, shortness in breathing, feeling a tight knot in the throat which impedes swallowing, etc.   Feeling anxiety for a short period of time is quite normal, but if ignored and not addressed properly in its causes, the anxiety will slowly grow to panick attacks, then generalised anxiety and chronic anxiety which will eventually lead to depression and some major mental illnesses.   Living with anxiety is troublesome not only for the person who is subjected to it but also for those around. The condition itself is debilitating and is affecting the quality of life of both the subject and the entourage.   Gradually it will turn into real illness, not only mental but physical too since the main organs are overloaded with stimulation and stressed. First to exhibit symptoms are usually the heart and the blood pressure, then the immune system and later one by one all the body organs are starting to function in a stressful manner because they are subjected to abnormal stimulation.   The condition is difficult to understand and cope with by the rest of let\u2019s say \u201cnormal people\u201d and this is why the ones exhibiting it are many times left behind, ignored in their suffering and labeled as \u201cweak\u201d. In fact, those subjected to anxiety are ten times stronger than the rest simply because if exposed to the same \u201cmental overstimulation\u201d, a \u201cnormal person\u201d would break more easily.\n\nAnxiety is an exaggerated manifestation of fear.

You may sit on your bed all day long, stuck in your mind about all the things that could go wrong!   Anxiety escalates overthinking. It forces you to imagine all possible scenarios. I mean, things that are probably never ever going to happen. But your anxious brain will be like, \u201cHey what if\u2026?\u201d   3.  Abandon Everything and Run For The Hills   Anxious people are always on the lookout for dangers. When they perceive even the slightest danger, their inner alarms will go off, promoting them to take immediate action.   Eg: A girl has relationship anxiety. If she detects a slightest change in her boyfriend's tone, her brain will be overcharged with all the possible explanations. Next thing you know she is planning how to break up with her boyfriend.   What I mean here is that people with anxiety generally become impulsive when triggered. Their reaction may not be entirely rational to the situation in hand.   4.  Physical Complaints   Mind and body are strongly connected with each other. When you have high anxiety, it will manifest as physical health issues because that is the only way you will start realising that something is wrong.   Constipation, loose motions, nausea, chest pain, stomach ulcers, frequent cough & cold, body aches, headaches are some of the health issues linked with anxiety.   Being in a state of constant anxiety can f##k up your immune system making you prone to infections, diseases and Illnesses.   I am a personal evidence of that. There was a time when I used to be so anxious that I would hardly eat and whatever I ate, I would puke. Guess what happened? My platelets came crashing down and I caught Tuberculosis.   Always remember that your mind and body are strongly linked with each other. You have to take care of both. Oh, not to forget your soul too \ud83d\udc93   Now, there are many other symptom of anxiety as well. I could quote the DSM-V, but the bottom line is that you need to take holistic care of yourself. Anxiety for whatever reason is not worth it. It ruins your daily life, sense of self, career and relationships. If you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety then talk to a trusted friend or even a psychologist.   Prioritize your happiness and health \ud83e\udd70   ~ Your Trusted Therapist\n\nI am a psychologist. However, this answer is not based only on my years of studying mental health, but also on my personal battle with anxiety.   As a child, when I had anxiety it would manifest as digestive issues or stomach aches. These are the physical symptoms of anxiety. Even today when I am anxious about a big interview or some important matter, I keep running to the loo.

It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head. Scattered   thoughts \u2014 inability   to   focus . The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even  what do I do next  become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand. Self soothing habits that are counterproductive.  Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can\u2019t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something\u2014anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay. These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an  aha  moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.

As I said, I\u2019m no proffesional to be sure If I have it or not. People around me don\u2019t believe me, my parents too, so they wouldn\u2019t let me go to a psychologist. I know shy people and I know I feel worse than them in social situations. I know my ,, shyness\u201d doesn\u2019t only come down to being shy in front of strangers or nervous when I talk to a crowd. I\u2019m anxious all the time. Just before I enter my classroom every morning, my stomach clenches. I\u2019m not a new student and I\u2019m not being bullied or scared by any of my classmates. I get shortness of breath before I meet up with my friends. Friends I\u2019ve known for over 10 years. I avoid or get nervous sometimes even when I talk to my own parents. I can\u2019t sing in front of them, jokingly, I can\u2019t loosen up and dance when we\u2019re listening to music. Being vocally examined by my teachers in front of the class about lessons I know like the back of my hand, makes my whole body shake, stomach ache, voice tremble and makes me want to throw my guts up. I get scared shitless when my phone rings and it isn\u2019t my mom. I usually just see who\u2019s calling, hang up and text them, because I just can\u2019t talk over the phone. There\u2019s a lot of things I can only say through a text. I stiffen up, blush, my hearts starts to pound whenever someone asks me a question about myself, because I\u2019m so scared they\u2019ll start making fun of my answer. Don\u2019t get me started on having a fight with someone, my heart starts beating so fast, I get all red and flustered and I get immediate diarrhea. When I go out in public by myself, I constantly look around to see if someone\u2019s staring at me and I get so self conscious that they are judging my hair, or my pimples or my eyebrows or the way that I look, or my crooked teeth that they can\u2019t even see, because I\u2019m not smiling. Ever. Cause I\u2019m just so scared. I don\u2019t dress up girly, do my hair or make up, because people are so used seeing me like this, I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say if I change. I\u2019m scared that even with a dress and a face full of make up they are still going to think that I\u2019m ugly. I stop myself mid talking and shut up, because I worry what I had said might have sounded weird. I feel so small and vulnerable when I\u2019m outside by myself, without a group of friends to raise my self esteem. In fact the other day I was in the bus and I gave two coins to the guy for my ticket, he had to give me one back as change, but he forgot and I didn\u2019t say anything to him, even though I needed the coin for another bus and I just ended up walking there. In the kindergarten there was one girl who used to sent her friend to threaten me and beat me up. I was too scared to stand up to her, but even more scared to tell the teacher. This ,, shyness\u201d has made me go through the most awkward moments of my life. Two years ago, I was so scared of people my age that I went out and played with the kids. I was 15 at the time and they were 10. My mom was worried about me, she\u2019d sent me to hang out with a girl from my class, who was also my neighbour, and her best friend. I wouldn\u2019t know what to say to them, even though, I\u2019ve grown up with them, so I would just sit down next to them and not say anything. Literally. Not even a ,, hi\u201d. And when they\u2019d get up to go somewhere else, I\u2019d just follow them quietly. That was two years ago, mind you. I was 15. And there\u2019s thousands more examples, I\u2019d need days to count out. Now, I don\u2019t know am I shy, have I spent too much time on tumblr, do I have anxiety, am I just lazy, or fucking weird and damaged, but whatever it is I just want it gone. I\u2019d give up anything to be fixed.\n\nWell, I ain\u2019t no psychologist to tell you.

I dealt with anxiety myself for 2 years of high school and overcame it in the summer after high school.   I will say what worked for me and the philosophy behind the approach I took.   I did not want to take medication because I did not want to deal with side effects or deal with the symptoms of my condition. I wanted to deal with the underlying factors causing the condition of anxiety that I got myself into .   Originally I really knew nothing about my condition or why I was feeling the way I did. I had head tingling and panic attacks without really knowing what they were so I ended up just doing some research online to become more knowledgable about anxiety in general.   I came across a website called AnxietyCentre.com which really was the breakthrough for me.   I learned that anxiety was a combination of both physiological and psychological factors that can't be resolved independently but jointly.    I learned that anxiety and stress are related. Anxiety causes stress and stress causes elevated anxiety.    To kill anxiety it is important to tackle the physiological and psychological factors that lead to anxiety and stress.   To tackle the psychological issues, you would want to discover what in your life is causing you to be anxious. What thinking patterns do you have that irritate your anxiety? For example , your thoughts may always be worrisome and fearful about whether or not you will lose your job. These thoughts and worries create the anxiety that you are experiencing. You'd want to work on changing your thoughts with a kind of technique called \"stopping and swapping\". Whenever you have trouble with a fearful or worrisome thought, you are going to want to stop that thought and swap it with a more rational or balanced thought. If you currently think, \"omg I am going to lose my job\" , then you'll want to swap that with \"I have no reason to think that because I am a good employee who isn't going to be laid off\"   These thoughts can be fears about anything and what you need to do is change your brain's thinking patterns and reaction to the stimuli that make you have a fearful or worrisome response . Calm thoughts lead to a calm brain.  Also if there are things you fear that you are avoiding you need to experiment with exposure therapy which gets you to expose yourself to the stimulus you are fearful about  instead of continuing to avoid it . In my case of anxiety, I would not leave the house for about 2-3 months due to being anxious about driving a car. I would have this weird feeling come upon me that the road was getting longer and that other cars were going to drive into me. I know it was irrational but it was something my brain was doing to me at the time. So instead of letting this continue to affect me, I went about driving as much as I could to train my brain to dissociate the stimulus of driving to the reaction of the fear of the road getting longer and the cars driving into me.  So basically, it's up to the individual to identify their own faulty thinking and associations and work at changing them. That is how you'd solve the underlying factors and causes of your condition of anxiety. Next is the physiological factors and this would include nutrition, exercise and meditation. Now I did not go all out on the nutrition other than trying my best to eat 3 solid meals per day as well as drinking enough water. I took a multi vitamin which helps with general functioning of the body and mind ;and fish oil which is said to help the brain.  I truly believe the multi and fish oil helped me to stay feeling well physiologically.  On the exercise portion, I would try to exercise for 20 minutes a day at least. Even if it is as simple as taking a walk around the neighborhood , you should just do it. Nothing will stop you if you get in the habit of exercising. Walking, running, cycling, even some weight lifting can help to alleviate anxiety. Some advise against very heavy weights for anxiety but  see what is right for you. I would then also say that meditation or deep relaxation techniques are the real anxiety killer. Anxiety gets your body and mind overstimulated and over-active. The way to reduce this overstimulation is to do any of the many meditation or relaxation techniques out there. Try mindfulness meditation which involves simply paying attention to your breath for a period of time (10-45 minutes works). There's deep breathing where you in breath for 7 seconds through your nose and out breath through your nose for 7 seconds. You'll want to make sure your stomach is moving when you breathe and not your chest. Again , there are may different techniques out there for you to investigate so just try each one out for yourself. This approach of attacking physiological and psychological causes is at the root of the very popular cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). I'd suggest trying to get a therapist of you can afford one because it can end up being very beneficial to you !! ** This isn't to say there are not other techniques or other ways to approach dealing with worry and anxiety but its pretty much what helped me to get rid of my anxiety (fully overcame it). **   Thanks for reading and I hope it helped. It isn't very in death stuff but just a brief answer on how to overcome anxiety without medication. You will overcome it if you overcome your worries and fears . It is that simple.\n\nThere's some great answers here.    I dealt with anxiety myself for 2 years of high school and overcame it in the summer after high school.

It is important to keep in mind that not everyone with GAD will have all of these symptoms, and most people with anxiety find that their anxiety ebbs and flows depending on what else is going on in their life. For example, the more stressful their external circumstances become, the more likely that their anxious symptoms will be exacerbated.   3 Common Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Intense worrying and often internal questioning about current, future and even past scenarios along with a focus on negative hypothetical outcomes. Example anxious thought: \u201cWhat if my son gets a bike? What if his father doesn\u2019t remind him to wear his new helmet when he rides? What if he falls off the bike, or worse a car comes and hits him? What if he cracks his head open? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t let him get a bike. Should I let him get a bike? It could be dangerous. Maybe I should let him get a bike, I don\u2019t want to be controlling. But what if he really hurts himself on the bike?\u201d   2. Replaying certain memories, thoughts, and\/ or experiences over and over again in their mind, and worrying about them.   Example: \u201cWhy did I say that stupid thing in that meeting? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Maybe they think I\u2019m stupid now? What a stupid thing I said. I should have known better. Will I get another chance to present to the board? What if they don\u2019t give me another chance? What if I lose my job because they think I\u2019m stupid? What if someone was recording the whole meeting? What if they tell other people outside the company? What if I have to start looking for a new job but nobody is hiring? I shouldn\u2019t have said that stupid thing at the meeting.\u201d   3. Physical symptoms and panic attacks:   The more intense anxiety often leads people to have physical symptoms like: increased heart rate, tingling in their hands, difficulty sleeping, pressured speech, and even panic attacks and other issues. In addition, many people with generalized anxiety disorder have an underlying \u201chot thought\u201d or deep underlying worry that they are either going to die or go crazy when they feel extremely anxious (even if they rationally know in their calmer moments that this is not true). Some people who have had panic attacks then become anxious and fixated on the fear that they will have future panic attacks.   The point is\u2026   Most people who suffer from GAD will struggle with frequent negative worrying about present, future, and or past experiences, thoughts, or potential scenarios. The good news is that although anxiety can be very difficult, it is very common and usually treatable with a combination of motivation to improve it, psychotherapy and\/or medications (in the more severe situations).\n\nMany people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or even sub-clinical anxiety that they are faced with on a daily basis.

We start feeling symptoms in various parts of the body like tightness in chest or palpitations, cold sweat, stomach cramps etc etc. What the body is doing is preparing for the flight, fight, freeze response which is a genetically inbuilt survival instinct. The person either runs away from the danger ( such as seeing a snake) or fights back (such as when someone attacks you) or just freezes as in shock. All these anxiety symptoms are meant to protect one's survival and wellbeing.   However in the modern society, we dont face many physical dangers. Our fears are more psychological and mostly imaginary. For example if your friends dont talk to you at school, your mind perceives it as a threat. The subconscious mind cannot distinguish between a real threat to your life and an imaginary sense of threat such as being ignored by your friends.   The subconscious mind reacts in exactly the same way, preparing your body for fight, flight or freeze response. Anxiety is a protective phenomenon. But when we start imagining everything in life as threatening, then the the body keeps reacting with anxiety all the time. And you suffer from anxiety symptoms, panic attacks and severe stress.   The answer is to reassure your sunconscious mind that there is no real threat. Learn to identify imaginary threats from real threats. And learn to relax.\n\nWhenever your mind perceives something as a threat ( it may be a real threat or an imaginary one), your subconscious mind starts reacting in order to protect you from that threat.

Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition  includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder  includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events \u2014 even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder  involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism  is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder  is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias  are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder  is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder  are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor   See your doctor if: You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors \u2014 if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help.

But, I\u2019ll try to put it in words.   It feels like being really, really scared. Like your life is being threatened kind of scared. You know logically you aren\u2019t in any imminent physical danger, but your body starts reacting as if you had a bomb strapped to you and you know it\u2019s going to go off, you just don\u2019t know when.   You can\u2019t relax or tell yourself everything is fine. There\u2019s no reasoning with anxiety. Your head starts burning, your heart starts pounding and all you want to do is claw yourself out of the stranglehold.   I\u2019m good at hiding it from people for short periods of time. I can appear very outgoing and engaging, but it\u2019s exhausting. As soon as I start to feel the anxiousness coming on, I politely take my leave.   I keep to myself a lot because of my anxiety. I try to avoid things that will trigger it, but often nothing at all can trigger it. You could be feeling fine, doing something you enjoy and suddenly you feel like that photograph is you and you can\u2019t make it stop.   I used to be ashamed of it and pushed myself into situations I knew made me uncomfortable\u2014 like my head is on fire uncomfortable.  Not anymore.   It\u2019s an illness, just like any other illness. It\u2019s no different than if I had to live with diabetes and manage my blood sugar. Only I have to manage my situations.\n\nHaving acute anxiety feels like this: This was done by an Australian photographer who goes by the name Beethy.

Everybody knows about this quality of ants.   But I thought a little deeper.   If a small insect keeps trying even after failing again and again on a tough path, then why do we intelligent beings require motivation for each and everything in life?   The answer to this tough question is-   Because we are intelligent beings.   We have a mind to think, as much as we can.   We think about probabilities, chances, future and miseries.   We ascertain results even before trying and then we keep fearing for a prospective failure.   We evaluate the complexity or roughness of a path on countless factors before deciding to step on it.   Thus we mostly end up turning away from our deeds or keep staring at that vertical wall in a deep dilemma, with fear and regret.   While an ant keeps moving forward with it's life and faces all circumstances without thinking, evaluating, fearing and expecting.   It tries and fails, but doesn't think much and returns with the same motivation. Story continued-   After a few minutes, I stopped my mom, returned to the temple and reached the same spot.   The ant was halfway up the wall and walking comfortably now. Overthinking is the root of low motivation.   Think a little and do a little more , to achieve results or at least earn precious experience for future.   I bet, you won't need any motivation.\n\nI was sitting silently in one corner of a temple, waiting for my mother to complete her prayers.

Mostly people keep too tough a target and then few roadblocks, or procastination can discourage them quickly. Keep very reasonable targets, and repeat this exercise everyday. If you want to run a marathon, break down huge target to smaller ones - Try to run 1 KM everyday. If that is too much, try to run 5 Minutes everyday. If that is too much, try to brisk walk 30 minutes everyday. When this lesser target seems very easy, move on to the more difficult target. When you are okay with that, move on the next level. There is always enough time ! Never fret about time. Not that you should get lazy and stop doing what you are doing, but never think that the speed in which you are working is very slow. It won't help. You always have enough time. You cannot run a marathon with just 1 month of training. You cannot be a great guitarist with just 3-4 months of practice. You cannot make millions by investing for just 2-3 years. There are always a genius who could do it, but mostly, we all are just  okay!   Have patience. Keep walking, no matter how small are your steps. Compare your today with where you were a month back. There would always be some improvement. You should not compare yourself with others who have done great, you have no idea how much support they had, or when did they start walking. The longer you walk, the farther you would go. But if you are always worried about time, you would get into haste, make mistakes, feel bad and then give up. Look at the poor : I am not sure about you, but this affects me. If I care about them, and if I am not strong and successful, then I won't be able to help them effectively. There are great successful people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet etc who are helping out the poor. They are able to because they succeeded in what they were doing.  Good luck with your life!\n\nThere are four ways you can motivate yourself.   Do what you love : Nothing is better than doing what you love to do. It is fun!

I had interviewed at a Fortune 100 company with 5 different hiring managers and 4 of them ranked me second to last.  My heart sank when I heard the news.   Guess what happened?  I bounced back.  I spent multiple days prepping for the interview with the 5th hiring manager.  He even asked me to deliver an impromptu presentation and I crushed it. I got the job offer.   When I was 23, I was in the worst shape of my life.  I would consistently eat chicken wings, burgers and pretty much anything you could put into a deep fryer.  Guess what happened?  I bounced back. I started doing home DVD workouts, eating more vegetables regularly and within 3 months I was in the best shape of my life. I celebrated by going to the beach for the first time in a year!   When I was 30, I told people I wanted to write motivational articles for the biggest and best online publications. Most people told me that was impossible. I pitched numerous editors and every single one of them turned me down or didn\u2019t respond. Guess what happened? I never gave up, I kept writing and now I have articles that have been published in Inc., Forbes, Fortune and Business Insider.      In those moments in life when everything seemed to be failing, I always found a way to get back on track.    I began to think back to all of those moments and I put together a list of ways to find motivation.     Here are the top 10:   1.   Be friends with people that inspire you   \u201cYou are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\u201d \u2013 Jim Rohn   I love this quote from Jim Rohn. If you\u2019re around highly motivated friends all the time, chances are you\u2019ll feel more energized just by spending time with them.    When one of my close friends built a series of iPhone apps and began to experience huge success, his eyes would light up with excitement and passion when he shared his stories.   I immediately started working on iPhone apps and have made 14 apps since I met him.  4 of those have hit the top 100 in different categories.     What would have happened if I had never met my friend?  Would I have built the iPhone apps?   Probably not.    Inspiration is contagious.  Surround yourself with people that motivate you to be great.   2.   Take baby steps   It\u2019s good to have big, audacious goals. All too often though, I see people sprinting to achieve their goals and expecting success quickly. When they don\u2019t find immediate success, they become deflated and give up.   Instead of solely focusing on one big goal, break that down into a series of smaller bite sized goals.     Having small goals that are more easily achievable will give you a sense of accomplishment and progress. It\u2019s very motivating to see small wins as time goes on. It also gives you a chance to celebrate along the way.      For example, when I started my blog my goal was to get to 100,000 subscribers.  I wanted to build an awesome community of folks that could share ideas on how to be passionate about life and lessons on how to build an online business. But 100,000 subscribers is a huge number. It definitely wasn\u2019t going to happen over night.    So what did I do?   I set a weekly goal.  For the 1st month, I set a goal of 10 subscribers per week.  For the 2nd month, I set a goal of 20 subscribers per week.    Did I always hit my goal?  Of course not.  But every week I felt like I was making progress.   And that motivates me to keep going.   3.   Reframe your problems   When we run into problems, it\u2019s easy to lose confidence and to give up. We\u2019re conditioned to avoid pain after all.   But what if we reframed the way we saw a problem?   I\u2019ll give you an example:     A few years ago, I was working with a client that was struggling to generate new business.  Leads weren\u2019t flowing in like they were in the past. Morale was low on the sales team.    Things sucked.     But what if we reframed the problem?  What if we stopped thinking of it as a problem and thought of it as an opportunity?  In other words - what if we stopped complaining about the lack of leads and spent our energy learning about how to generate new ones?   After a few weeks of research and collaboration with other companies, we decided to run a marketing campaign consisting of creative emails and warm follow up calls.   The result?  We closed a monster deal worth over $800,000 from that campaign.     4.   Take 5 minutes every day to be grateful   It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday work.  Often times we find ourselves wishing for what we want, rather than being grateful for what we already have.     I have a friend who almost died from Nephrotic Syndroe when he was in his early twenties. Luckily he found a kidney donor and is alive today. Most days he wakes up and says he\u2019s just grateful to see the sunrise.     Everytime I feel down, I think of his story and realize how grateful I should be for everything I have in my life:  My health, my friends, my family and the opportunity to make a difference in the world. You can bet that I get motivated every single time I think of that story.    Take 5 minutes each morning thinking about something you\u2019re grateful for in life. You\u2019ll be glad that you did.    5.   Mix up your workout    Working out is a great way to motivate yourself.  The problem is that if you run every day, your body plateaus and adapts to that workout.  A great way to keep things exciting and challenging is to mix up your workouts.  For example, you could take spin classes on Monday, run on Tuesday, weight lifting on Wednesday and well, you get the point.  By challenging yourself to try new workouts, you\u2019ll test your limits. When you\u2019re able to go beyond those limits, you\u2019ll feel a huge sense of pride and accomplishment. The energy you get from the workouts will carry over into the rest of your life.     6.   Run the 5 minute test   Whenever I find myself struggling to start something, I try to apply the \u201c5 minute test.\u201d  Here\u2019s how it works.   Whatever it is that you want to do (we\u2019ll use working out as an example), tell yourself that you have to give it a go for at least 5 minutes.  I mean, seriously, is it really that hard to try something for 5 minutes?  99% of the time, it isn\u2019t.    Here\u2019s the best part: Once you start, it\u2019s really hard to stop usually.  That\u2019s because you\u2019ve already built a freight train of momentum.   For example, if I change into my gym clothes and start a jog for 5 minutes, chances are I will want to keep going.  Do I really want to quit after I spent 3 of those minutes to change into gym clothes?   Didn\u2019t think so.   Try the 5 minute test.  You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you can accomplish once you get going.     7.   Go to sleep   Have you ever tried to be really productive when you\u2019re tired and cranky?   I think we all have and the results are usually disastrous. It\u2019s hard to focus, you burn out easily and ultimately it\u2019s hard to do great work.   In one of my old jobs, I traveled to over 50 cities in a year for work.  I was tired 90% of the time. Guess what happened? I lost my passion for work and I burned out.   You can only drink so many cups of coffee before it no longer has an effect on you.  So try this instead:   Go to sleep.   Take a nap for 20 minutes.  Or better yet, get a solid 8 hours of sleep (or more if you\u2019re playing catch up).  Do this consistently.    It\u2019s really important to take care of yourself. You can\u2019t help others if you can\u2019t help yourself first.   And when you wake up, you\u2019ll feel refreshed and motivated to do great things again.    8.   Remember why you started   One of my top apps was a dating app.  Someone once asked me why I was building it.   A lot of answers crossed my mind including:   It was a huge market opportunity. It would be a fun app to build. It was an untapped demographic.   But when I thought long and hard, I realized that my \u201cwhy\u201d was really simple and boiled down to one thing: I wanted to help people fall in love.     And that was more motivating to me than any other reason. And whenever we ran into problems in working on the app, I would always think of why we were building it in the first place and that always motivated me to make it better.  Because you know what?  Helping people fall in love is awesome.   So remember why you started.   9.   Put it on your calendar   \u201cI\u2019ll do it later.\u201d  Admit it, this thought crosses our minds all the time, doesn\u2019t it?   I know it does for me. One of the hardest things to do in staying motivated is to hold yourself accountable. We always think that there\u2019s more time later on to get stuff done. You know what ends up happening half the time? I totally forget to do it.   Here\u2019s a neat trick to help you overcome procrastination: Put it on your calendar.    If you block off time for that activity, chances are you\u2019re more likely to do it.     10. Celebrate   Don\u2019t be in such a rush to get to the end goal.  Life\u2019s a heck of a marathon and you need to make sure you enjoy the ride. So next time you accomplish something, take a break and celebrate that win with people, no matter how small or big it is.     Because you know what, sharing positivity is awesome.\n\n\u201cYou were ranked second to last in 4 of your interviews.  You won\u2019t be getting a job offer.\u201d   I remember hearing my manager say that to me when I was 22 and looking to land my first serious job.  I had interviewed at a Fortune 100 company with 5 different hiring managers and 4 of them ranked me second to last.  My heart sank when I heard the news.   Guess what happened?  I bounced back.  I spent multiple days prepping for the interview with the 5th hiring manager.  He even asked me to deliver an impromptu presentation and I crushed it. I got the job offer.

Don't allow shit to create more shit in your life.  5. Gratitude Wake up in the morning and spend at least 10 minutes thinking of all the things that are priceless in your life. Try to think of at least 1 new thing everyday. When you go to bed, think of the most awesome moment in that day, no matter how small but think and thank. And think of how lucky you are for everything in your life. So many people strive for all this. 6. Vision Board Make a vision board. Post pictures or paintings\/diagrams of all the things you want from shoes to car to house to business. Focus on the kind of life you desire. Make a plan for each year, month, week and day. Decide at the beginning of each month what you plan to achieve to get closer to that BIG dream of yours. Make chunks of that monthly task in weekly form. At the last day of each week, assign daily tasks. 7. Wake up early   and eat fresh You have no idea how much this helps. You tend to stay more motivated,focused and hydrated. You are more energetic and in the morning, you get the time to think and plan your day in advance. In my university days, I followed a very unique schedule. I used to sleep around 7 and wake up at 3:30. This ensured I have enough time to study and plan my day. Many people exclaimed that I was the most organized and motivated person around. Also, you get the time to look good. ;) 8. Surround yourself with positive people Quickly chuck out people who bring you down and surround yourself with people who truly care for you and are honest and motivating. It makes tonnes of difference.   And if you ever feel low, you can ping me. All the best! :)\n\n1. Love yourself.  It is soooo important. More than anything else.

You wonder why you signed up for an Ironman event in such humidity.

Red bull, coke, electrolytes, energy gels, the sugar rush in those calories has died down. Your system does not respond anymore.   There\u2019s ice cubes inside your trisuit hugging your tummy, your buttocks, some of them have slipped through and reached your scrotum.   It\u2019s a very delicate point.   You can give up, sit down and call it a day. Unfortunately, all the hours of training do not help you, it\u2019s all in the past. Why would you keep pushing and run the remaining 14 kms when everything is against you?   It\u2019s you, your thoughts, the icky feeling around your body and the humidity of Goa. You look at your watch, and it\u2019s noon. Sweat has trickled down your forehead, onto your visors and you cannot even see ahead properly.   It\u2019s time to stop! Maybe just stop for a bit and feel good again, or just stop for a long time and quit.   Unfortunately, no one ever teaches you how much of madness is enough, how long your \u201cpassion\u201d will take you ahead until reality comes biting.   And then, you see another aid station. You soak your head in ice cold water, pour it all over yourself. You gulp some more coke, grab a few oranges and keep running.   You slap yourself once, twice and keep running.   You stop, you stop those negative thoughts, and you keep running.   You cramp up, you can\u2019t lift your feet anymore, all the ice and water has soaked your feet, your shoes are at least a kilogram heavier, but you keep running.   You always keep running, and in no time you\u2019re at the finish line.   The mind will always ask you to quit, keep you in your comfort zone and fuck with your sanity because that\u2019s exactly how it is programmed to, but you don\u2019t have to listen to it every-time, sometimes you can overpower your thoughts, cry a bit, get emotional, visualise the finish line and keep running.   No matter what, you always keep running!   \u201cThe truth is motivation is a myth! It\u2019s the most useless concept marketed and circulated. The only reason you push past your limits is when you know \u201cthe why\u201d. Why are you studying? Why are you working so hard? Why is it so important to finish an Ironman event? Why?   When you have the \u201cwhy\u201d sorted in your mind, it\u2019ll be easy to find all the tools to fight the negativity in your mind.\u201d Footnotes [1]  Login \u2022 Instagram\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate point, after a 2km swim, 90 km cycle going through brutal elevations, you find yourself at the 7th km mark of a 21 km run.

Congratulations, my friend, you've successfully achieved the first big rock. Always keep your eyes on the stars, but never forget that you're living on the ground. This quote has really motivated me since the beginning. Motivation has two main facets: one, do what you like to do and second, know what you're doing. To keep it simple, its like if you're reading a book, select a genre which develops intellectual curiosity in you and encourages you to know more about it.   Practically, being motivated isn't as easy as it sounds like. Believe it or not, it is actually all dependent on your HABITS. Because First you make your Habits, then the Habits makes You. So set positive habits on daily basis and keep reminding yourself time to time that you've got to invest in yourself daily. You're the greatest asset you'll ever receive, so why look for something else to improve rather than your own self. To make it easy i\u2019d tell you some really easy and applicable daily life steps Practice living CONSCIOUSLY. Imagine an entrepreneur and an office worker. The entrepreneur comes home and decides to spend some quality time everyday, by not watching TV and telling his family and parents how did he spent his day. On the other hand, consider this office worker, who comes home and just dozes off for hours without even changing. Who's gonna be more motivated towards the end of the day? REFLECT Practice Self Acceptance. You just need one second to change your life.. and believe me that second will not come unless you accept yourself just as you are. You don't need others to praise you in order to be motivated. Rather self satisfaction comes from within and that is what really matters. Improve everyday by a little and you'll soon start to like yourself Be a lot less them, and a little more You. Just BE YOURSELF. See interviews of the most successful CEOs and Entrepreneurs on YouTube and you'll end up with one lesson Do what makes you happy. Because doing what excites you and what keeps you on the track, on purpose is gonna get you motivated. Whatever you do remember that motivation doesn't in the form of reading books or seeing motivational videos it comes from  Striving for your goals and ambitions.\n\nTo ask how to be motivated, is itself the first step towards self motivation.

Why is it so hard to stay disciplined?   Because we allow our mind to interfere in the path of discipline. Why do we fail to get up early in the morning? Because the mind says, \u201cYou are so tired and sleep deprived. Just sleep for 5 minutes more and it will be fine\u201d. Then 5 becomes 10, and it is all the way downhill after that.   We allow the fallacy that we will get up early or eat healthy or study well or do the right thing  when we get used to it and it becomes a little easier .   But it will  NEVER  get easier. It will never be easy to get up at 5 am, every single day of the year. Not now, not after 10 years.   So what should you do? The answer is trivially simple, but also very hard. You have to  stop listening  to your mind. Just stop. No concession to what your mind says.   When you have to do something hard, you have to  become a robot . It does not matter  how you feel . Who cares? Just execute the plan like a machine. That is the only way.   If you decide to go for a run, get up and run. You will feel groggy and your legs will hurt. The pain you feel is exactly the pain everybody else feels.  The pain of discipline is the price of happiness .

Many of you are aware of it, once I got a chance to taste its biryani and trust me, I had never eaten such a tasty biryani before.   Now, I have complimented Paradise Biryani. Some curiosities must have been aroused in your mind, am I right? The distance between Gachhibowli (IT park of Hyderabad) and Paradise Biryani House is approximately 15 km.   Now, let us consider following assumptions :- Two people are hungry (Not too hungry, but hungry). Both have 500 Rupees in their pocket. They both are living in Gachhibowli Let us assume, that Paradise Biryani house is the best Biryani vendor in the world. Since they have enough money and time to spend, they decided to eat Biryani in Paradise.   After travelling 5 km, first person sees \u201cTandoori Chicken\u201d on the road side. He stops there and eats it.   Since he ate chicken, he got thirsty. So after travelling another 5 km he stops to have a cold drink.   And when he reaches Paradise: Second person already finished his Biryani. First person is not hungry anymore, but wants to taste it. Since he wasn\u2019t hungry at all, he didn\u2019t enjoy the Biryani. And most of the food was wasted. Now, I am done with my analogy.   If first person wanted to enjoy Biryani, he could have enjoyed it. If he had controlled his temptations for Tandoori.   Same goes with Self Discipline, it is directly related to temptation.   I can\u2019t give any tips or tricks to control your temptation. Because, I can\u2019t stop you. I can\u2019t watch you when you are alone. I can\u2019t monitor your doings.   \u201cParadise\u201d Restaurant is like your destination. How badly you want to taste success, that depends on you.   If you want to maintain self discipline,   \u201cYou need to control your temptations.\u201d  Don\u2019t satisfy yourself by temporary pleasures, and stay hungry until you taste your success. Now, one more thing I want to add here.   People make mistakes, some learn from it. Some accept it as their fate, and some regret their decisions.   Sometimes, things won\u2019t go according to the plan. You need to learn to let it go. Don\u2019t regret your decision and keep wasting time on it.

At first you have to beat some initial resistance, which, much like when you attempt to push a box from a standstill, often requires more energy than the work thereafter.   Once you are working you often find it easy to keep going, as that initial force you used usually carries you quite a ways.   This initial force is your Motivation.   Motivational Force is the force needed to get you  into action from rest.   On some days this will be the force that gets you started on a discipline or habit that turns your life around, while on other days you need a lot of motivation to merely get off the couch.   No matter what it is, you  always  need some form of Motivation to do anything, and most times need  multiple  moments of motivation a day.   Discipline, on the other hand, is not a force, like motivation, that keeps you going, but rather a lever that reduces that threshold of energy needed to get into, and stay in, action.   The stronger your Discipline is, the lower the required Motivational force needs to be.   Emotions come into play as they act like a  boost  to your motivation.   Passion, Drive, Calling, Reason, and the overused version of  \u201cMotivation\u201d  are all  emotional  boosts.   A boost, however, is  not required  to take action.   It makes the initial force stronger, but often at the cost of exhaustion later, causing most people to seek it to have an easier start, but also falling off much sooner.   Which is why it is not Motivation, but  Discipline , that is the key to action. Motivation is nice.   Feeling passionate, having a strong drive, or knowing why you do what you do definitely helps.   But in the light of all that life throws at you, with everything going on in the world, and with emotions playing jump-rope with most people every day, it is just not reliable.   Having big goals or dreams, however,  requires  a lot of  consistent  effort.   Which means you cannot rely on something as feeble as Motivation to get you there.   Instead you should use whatever motivation you can muster as your starting force  to obtain discipline.   Meaning that your motivation should not try to carry you to the end of your goals or dreams, but should help you set up a discipline that can.   Just that small change in your approach and intention, can drastically alter where your energy goes.   Your mind will segment it better, saving the energy for the long run rather than blowing it all in the starting phases, and will often carry you much further.   Remember that a lot of people start strong, but very, very few finish what they started.   This can best be seen by the  Forbes Health New Year\u2019s Resolution Statistics  which show that over 50% of Resolutions are dropped within before April, while only about 7% make it to the end of the year. If you want to stick to your goals you have to  make your goal the discipline itself first.   To make that easier  start with something  very  easy,  to the point where it almost feels free or like a given you will achieve it.   For instance, you might start with just going for a 5 minute walk every day.   While that does not match your goal of getting incredibly fit yet, just this small act will be a gateway to more.   Eventually you will increase the time you walk, or the distance, after which you might switch your 15 minute walk to a 15 minute jog.   Soon, 15 minutes turns into 30, and now you are already losing weight and becoming fitter.   On the journey there you plateau because of your diet and you add another tiny habit of just drinking one extra glass of water a day and adding one more serving of vegetables, and the process increases from there.   If you do this, within a year or two you will be jogging for an hour, eating a pretty balanced diet, and may have added a strength workout to boot.   But if you set high, difficult, and challenging habits, you will be more likely to quit before you start.   Consider not how you feel in the moment you set your goals or disciplines, for those emotions will  not  last, but rather how you may feel  on your worst day.   If you can find a habit that is so easy, simple and given that you believe you can still do it on your worst day, then you will very likely continue it indefinitely.   Start so small you have no excuse  not  to do it.\n\nDoing your work, improving your life and getting into action about anything, always involves the same process.

Start Small   You don't need to wake up as a completely different person. As a cultural event, people tend to make resolutions on New Year's Day: They say, this year will be different. Well, you can make this year different, but you don't need to change everything at once. For best results, pick just one thing.   Otherwise, you can overwhelm yourself with too many changes to make at once. This defeats your intention of becoming a more self-disciplined person.   2. Identify What You Want to Do Differently   Do you even like kale smoothies? Do you want to? While drinking one may seem like the noble, healthy thing to do, it's not likely to make you a better person. It may make you an insufferable jerk, though, if you are only doing it for the wrong reasons.   If you're focusing on health, pick something that is practical and that will make a real difference in your life, and ideally, that you enjoy. That could be going to the gym, walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator or limiting the ice cream you eat.   3. Remember You Are an Adult   Again, you can start small. If you normally sit at your desk and play on your phone until your manager comes by and gives you a new task, set your phone timer for five minutes. Then, when the alarm goes off, go find your manager and ask for something new to do.   Better? Work with your manager to establish such clarity about your goals and the expectations about your contributions in your job that you never have to ask your manager what to do. You just move on to the next task. (Perhaps you may never play on your phone at all. It's conceivable.)   4. Make a List   Part of self-discipline is knowing what you need to do and then doing it. When you're not used to behaving in a disciplined manner, you will sometimes struggle to come up with your next activity.   You can make the tasks work-related or plan part of your day for personal items. Everything from emails to laundry to a stop at the grocery store can go on the list. Checking the items off the list can help you towards developing self-discipline.   5. Make Choices in Advance   If your goal is to pay attention in meetings, choose to leave your phone at your desk. Don't even put it in your pocket. You can't play with it if it's not there.   If you want to become more self-disciplined about food, ask the waitress to box up half your meal before she puts it in front of you or choose to always eat just half of the sandwich.   If you want to get on top of your emails, decide how many emails you'll respond to before doing something else, whether it is five, 10, or all of them. Just decide before the situation presents itself and you'll find it a lot easier to remain steadfast in the face of temptation.   6. Make Use of Technology   Technology makes people flighty\u2014they can always check Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, not to mention playing games and texting friends. But there are also technological tools that can help you build self-discipline.   Additionally, you can set timers that limit the amount of time you spend playing a game or on your favorite time-wasting website. You can use one that tracks your time to give you an idea of how you spend it and then work from there to lower the number of hours you spend being unproductive.   If your goal is a fit lifestyle with a healthy weight, regular exercise, serious walking, and restful sleep each night, trackers exist to help you. Fitbit, for example, helps you track all of this. While you need to record some of the data, Fitbit connects with other devices to automatically capture, as one example of its capabilities, your weight from a synchronized scale.   7. Recognize Your Limited Temptation Capabilities   If a self-disciplined life was easy, everyone would practice self-discipline. But, it's not. However, did you know that every temptation you avo...\n\n1. Start Small   You don't need to wake up as a completely different person.

Once you continue this daily writing habit for 30 days, you will automatically be inclined to writing daily.   You will feel as if something is missing in the day if you have not written.   This is the power of discipline.   You will then find all the ways and means to improve your writing( or any other craft ). You get intrinsically motivated by following a discipline.

New girlfriend.   She was sleeping with some guy she worked with. This time at Maryland, where we both attended school. The moment I found out was one of the most indescribable moments of my life. Anger is scary. Sadness is humbling. Don\u2019t combine them. Don\u2019t walk that close to the edge.   Somewhere between life and discussing death so often, I noticed that things stopped mattering. Perhaps only recently, or perhaps far earlier. I used to be motivated by being someone. I wanted to be the best. I wanted to be successful. I wanted to be noticed, attractive, powerful. It makes sense. It\u2019s important.   Until it isn\u2019t.   After all of the being, wanting, having, I just \u201c was \u201d. I stopped having vengeful ideas. I stopped needing to impress. I guess I \u201c got \u201d, and it didn\u2019t saturate me. I made my own personal waves, and they washed over unannounced. I wanted to graduate college; I got a double major. I wanted to be good at hockey; I was the captain of the team. I wanted to get a good job; I started making 6 figures. I wanted to build a YouTube channel; I got 20,000 subscribers. I wanted, wanted, wanted. But no matter what, I was never good enough for \u201c her \u201d. Whoever she was. Wherever she was. Some faceless idea of a girl. \u201c She \u201d was my motivation.   Weird, right? Most guys won\u2019t admit that. Most guys won\u2019t admit that they\u2019re still struggling with this. Struggling with desire. Hope. Hunger. And maybe it\u2019s all for \u2018 her \u2019. Even if she\u2019s nowhere, now. Or maybe that\u2019s just me.   It\u2019s a strange place to be.   These days I\u2019m slightly jaded, I suppose. I\u2019m driven deeply by a desire to save people the heartache I\u2019ve endured. Even if I\u2019ve only scratched the surface of explanation. My biggest motivation is not necessarily to increase people\u2019s happiness, but to subtract from their sadness. To alleviate the residual qualms of lives like mine. And from there, everything motivates me. Things you wouldn\u2019t think about. The normality of life. It\u2019s all quite sad. I see sadness in people. I see sadness in you. The way you walk. Your dress shirt. Your aging leather belt. Your McDonald\u2019s coffee. This day wasn\u2019t yours. But that you lives. And that you dies. And that\u2019s sad, to me. And sadness is my motivation.   On a fundamental level, I need this. I need an existential benefit. I need to change. I need to experience. She taught me this. Or maybe I taught me this. Life taught me this, and I\u2019m grateful to be a life-long student.   Today I am motivated by love. I\u2019m motivated by fear. I\u2019m motivated by hope. Some things will never change.   The most motivational speeches I ever heard were from people who told me I couldn\u2019t do it. Whatever \u201c it \u201d is. Not because I want to prove them wrong, but because I want to prove  me right . I want to know I\u2019ll never let me down, because I\u2019ve been let down by others so often. I want to be my biggest rock. I want to  know  I will, even if you  know  I won\u2019t. One of us knows, and I\u2019ll be damned or dead before I\u2019m wrong.   Get your heart broken. Build walls. Then tear them down to find out your own strength. Be told that you won\u2019t. And when you do, forgive them for their doubt. The greatest revenge is not massive success. The greatest revenge is none. And when you learn this, the world needs more of you.   This is my motivation.   \u2764\ufe0f Augie\n\nShe was sleeping with some boy from some college out of state.

As is well known, the Japanese love fresh fish. Such has been Japan\u2019s fascination with eating fresh fish that, for many years now, there\u2019s hardly any fish to be found in the waters off Japanese shores. So fishermen came up with a solution. They built bigger boats and went farther from the shore to catch fish. Unfortunately, this created another problem. The farther they went to fish, the longer it took them to get back to the shore. By the time they got back, the fish was stale. And the Japanese, well, they like their fish fresh. To solve this problem, the fishermen came up with another solution. They installed refrigeration units on the boats. But the Japanese were clearly clever, discerning folks. They could tell the difference between frozen fish and fresh fish. And they wanted their fresh fish. Besides, frozen fish commanded lower prices, threatening the viability of the entire fishing business.   So the fishermen came up with another solution. They installed fish tanks on the boat! They would catch fish from the sea and put them into the tank. So they could now take back fresh fish!   But that was not to be either. As the tank got stuffed with fish, the fish would flap around a bit, then get lazy and lie resigned to their fate. Motionless. Inactive. Dull. And the Japanese could tell the difference. They wanted fresh fish, not sluggish fish!   Even as a seemingly insurmountable crisis loomed over the Japanese fishing industry, the wise fisherfolk came up with yet another innovative solution. They still had to sail out a long distance. And they still had the same boats and the same fish tanks. But there was one difference. In each tank, the fishermen put in a small shark. The shark kept the fish active, running around, busy. Sure, the shark ate a few fish but the threat of the shark kept the other fish active and healthy. The challenge ensured that none of them could afford to lie still. As a result, what eventually reached the shore was fresh, active fish. And the Japanese loved it!   We are like fish too. We need that shark to stay sharp. In case you or your organization is slowly slipping into the comfort zone, it may be a good idea to bring in a shark.   Remember, the shark may eat some fish but that\u2019s a small price to pay for keeping the rest of them active. Get your shark. Today!   Get out of the comfort zone.   If there\u2019s no enemy, create one. Small price to pay to keep yourself motivated!!   Set a purpose in your life, what you want to do in the next upcoming years, the target you set will itself suffice the motivation.   .   .   .   .   .   Another example from the same book.   Goals: The Secret to Making Your Dreams Come True True story? Not sure. But the story goes that in 1963, some behavioural scientists performed an experiment with the graduating class of Harvard Business School. They asked the students if they had written down goals for themselves. Their goals for life. For the future. On paper.   A mere 3 per cent of the class had actually written down goals. Yes. Just 3 per cent.   Well, twenty-five years later, the scientists again got in touch with the class of \u201963. To find out how they had done in their careers. And in their lives.   And guess what?   They found that the net worth of the 3 per cent of the class that had written down goals was MORE than the net worth of the rest of that batch. Not just that; the 3 per cent written-down-goalwallahs seemed to be happier, doing what they wanted and leading far more fulfilling lives.   Incredible. But, I believe, it\u2019s true. And it could be true for all of us.   What are your goals? What do you want to achieve? What do you want to be, have, do? In life. At work. In relationships. Whatever it be, write it down. Now. Just write it down. Not later, not tomorrow\u2014now!   And commit yourself to action.  Commit yourself to doing what it takes to achieve your goals. Take action. Make sure that everything you do is taking you closer to your goals. (If it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t do it.)   And finally, take a step today. However small it may be, but take that first step today. If you want to lose weight, walk that 45-minute walk\u2014today! If you want to be the best salesperson, make that extra sales call\u2014today!   You\u2019ll see the difference. As the Nike guys would say, just do it. It takes just  three steps.   Step   one :  Write down your goals.   Step   two :  Make a commitment to action, to doing what it takes.   Step   three :  Take the first step. Today!   Come on, make a beginning. You owe it to yourself. And you have nothing to lose.   .   .   .   .   What are your goals? What do you want to be, have, do? Whatever it be, write it down.   Now after you have decided your goals; it's like a difficult task just like a huge mountain to climb.  So another example. Climbing the mountain   If two people are trying to climb a mountain together, what\u2019s the most important thing they need to get to the top? Is it equipment? Or training? Or teamwork? Or favourable weather conditions?   Well, they need all of these for sure. But the most important thing is the mountain itself. They need a clear goal!   Too often, we get obsessed with the equipment and the training but have no clear goals. The best mountain-climbing equipment is of little use if you don\u2019t have a mountain to climb.   We are all very fortunate. We have the most fabulous equipment there is. We have access to training. And there are colleagues out there, waiting to help us succeed. But we need to have our own mountains. Our own goals.   And once you have your own mountain to climb, everything changes. Magically. You get a sense of purpose. You begin to want to climb that peak. You become disciplined. You get up early, you brave the cold, you watch your diet, you seek out experts, you read the books \u2026 All because you now have a mountain to climb. A peak to conquer.   So instead of complaining about your equipment or your training, and worrying about buying more sophisticated equipment, set your own goals first.   Find your own mountain. That could be the first step towards transforming your whole life.   Go ahead. Write down your goals. Today.   Get your own mountain. And take the first step towards feeling on top of the world.   The best mountain-climbing equipment is of little use if you don\u2019t have a mountain to climb. .   .   .   .   Sometimes it occurs that even after lot of hard work, we don't get any results, so here's a story called as  The Chinese Bamboo. The Chinese Bamboo   My favourite spot at home\u2014and my wife\u2019s pride and joy\u2014is a little palm-and-bamboo garden she\u2019s managed to create in the balcony of our apartment. So every morning, that\u2019s where we sit and devour the day\u2019s newspapers, with some freshly brewed south Indian filter coffee making the news seem just a wee bit more interesting!   And it\u2019s probably this new patch of green that sparked off my interest in the Chinese bamboo. A tree that grows really tall\u2014to a height of over eighty feet. It takes around five years and three months to grow to its full height. But here\u2019s the interesting bit. For the first five years after you plant the seed, you see nothing. Absolutely nothing. Except perhaps a little shoot springing out of the bulb and struggling to make a squiggle.   And then, in the next ninety days, it shoots up to a towering eighty feet.   Can you believe it? For the first sixty months, all the growth is invisible, below the surface. The Chinese bamboo\u2019s roots create a complex network, like a miniature version of the London Underground. It is these strong roots that, when fully developed, help support a tree that will soar above all else.   And in the next ninety days\u2014yes, merely ninety days\u2014it literally takes off. And becomes as tall as an eight-storeyed building.   In this era of instant coffee and fast food, of get-rich-quick schemes and lose-weight-quicker regimens, of quarterly earnings and month-on-month growth, perhaps we all need to pause and take a lesson from the Chinese bamboo.   Patience has its reward. Nothing of substance happens in a jiffy. All too often, we are unwilling to wait for the pay-off, and tend to settle for shorter trees.   Having sown the seed and having initiated something, when we don\u2019t see results, we get impatient. We keep pulling out the sapling to check if the roots are growing. (Well, when you do that, they don\u2019t!)   As leaders and bosses, we tend to be impatient for results. And often, too often, we rush to reward the mushrooms that spring up after one spectacular rainy night (and wither away soon after)\u2014only because we can see them! Long-term, sustainable successes take time, and a good question to ask yourself is whether your leadership style encourages\u2014or even allows\u2014the growth of the Chinese bamboo. Or are you creating an organization of stunted, but quickly visible trees?   Every major achievement is almost always preceded by years of toil, hard work, failure, stress, tests of character, determination, sleepless nights \u2026 All of which help form the network of roots that can then support real accomplishments. And eighty-feet-tall trees.   So the next time you feel frustrated by lack of results and want to give up, don\u2019t. Think of the Chinese bamboo.   When you feel the world is unjust and is refusing to recognize your hard work and your commitment, don\u2019t panic. Five years of subterranean activity will almost always be followed by three months of meteoric rise.   And ah, yes, after years of slogging it out in relative obscurity, when you finally achieve success, be prepared for people to say: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s so lucky. He\u2019s become an overnight success!\u2019   If only they knew about the Chinese bamboo! Patience has its reward. Nothing of substance happens in a jiffy. Thanks for reading!!

You learn from your surroundings therefore you perceive through your senses. Hence we think everything can be learned from outside. That is why many people forget to look within. Things that should come from within then need external stimuli to come out. I think that explains why we think that motivation is something which comes from outside when it actually is something within.\n\nJanice Cook Observer of life;Older and hopefully wiser!  \u00b7  Author has  221  answers and  417.8K  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 9y Related How come people lose motivation when others are better than they are?\n\nLoss of motivation in this case is the result of irrational thinking.

Positive thinking showed him a civilised way to live and coexist with his fellowmen and families. It not only benefited him but his fellowmen too.

Follow these points- Keep yourself positive. Read inspirational books. Always think that whatever has happened was good and that whatever will happen is for good. Don\u2019t get disheartened by failures. Remember, every failure is a new beginning. Learn from failures and rectify the mistakes. Do meditation. It will help you cool, calm and relaxed. Follow spirituality. Be in the company of good people. Keep praying to God. Remember, God is with you and gives you what is best for you. Be a hard worker. Have a goal in life and work towards it.\n\nIt feels really to good to share what you do to feel positive and stay motivated in this ever consuming world.

They don't ever let you down and you can completely rely upon them . So read a lot . I make it a point to read self help books . I make it a point that I read a few pages at night before I go to sleep. For those of you who are new to reading recommend you to read any of the books . The Power of your subconscious mind The Secret. Think and Grow Rich. The Power of Now. Who moved my cheese. What is really important here which has helped me a lot is that more than reading, you have to remind yourself during the day to try and inculcate what you have read into your daily life and thinking. You can set reminders in your phone througout the day at regular intervals to remind you to apply what you are reading in your life. Another thing that I try when I need motivation is watching videos on YouTube. There are so many channels on YouTube which will uplift your spirit in a minute and make you feel all charged up. Some of which I am sharing here below. Goalcast Robin Sharma Sandeep Maheshwari Jay Shetty Absolute Motivation Now this may make you feel as if I am a crazy guy, I talk to myself. I stand in front of a mirror and stare into my eyes and talk openly and not just in my mind. For those of you who have never tried it. Do it once. Just stand up now and go in front of your mirror and speak your heart out. Remind yourself of what strong and hard-working deserving person you are. Talking to myself in the mirror has helped me stop from self doubting my actions and my decisions in life. Talking to the people who are close to my heart has always been a very important source of motivation for me. I speak to my family, my siblings and my friends when I am feel low and need their support. There are always some people on whom you can reply upon with your eyes closed. Make sure you talk to them . They won't let you down. I believe that our Brain is divided into various parts which include love, happiness, sorrow, pain, joy, stress, loneliness, self doubt . What I try to do is channelize myself to focus on that part of the brain which only radiates happiness and joy and all other positive emotions. I'll accept, it's easier said than done but I try it and succeed quite a lot of times. Try it and keep on trying it until it comes to you naturally and you don't have to try anymore. I believe in spirituality and hence I make it a point to at least for sometime during the day I close my eyes and meditate. The benefits of meditation needs no explanation and one has to only experience to enrich yourself from it. Meditation gives me peace of mind and brings a sense of stability in my life which helps me in getting less affected by the ups and downs of the life. Express Gratitude at least once a day for whatever good has happened in your life. We human beings are programmed in such a way that we always look at the downside and negativity first . I make it a point to express my gratitude to the universe which has given me so many wonderful things in life. It helps you feel good and you feel lucky and motivated . My life has been a rollercoaster but I have always made a point in life to never give up without giving your best for anything. For whatever I have done in life I've always tried to give my best whatever the situation may come. I've always believed in the greater good and that there are forces operating in this universe that are powerful beyond what we can fathom which are always working to give me all the best that deserve in this world. See , in this world there are two sources of happiness that one can enjoy. One is happiness which has a short term shelf life e.g - watching a movie or talking to a friend and another is happiness with a long term shelf life, e.g - completing your goals, clearing that exam. One should always ask yourself whether what I am doing right now will result in me enjoying happiness which has a long term shelf life. If the answer to the above is yes then my friend you are on the path to glory. In the end I always say and believe from all my life experiences is that external sources of motivation are temporary in nature. They don't last long and you will again go back to square one after some time.   For Me -   SELF MOTIVATION IS THE BEST MOTIVATION.   Find motivation from within and you will not have to go scouting for motivation from the outside world.   All the best .\n\nIt feels really to good to share what you do to feel positive and stay motivated in this ever consuming world.

That person can evolve solutions to handle any complex issues gradually. Three basic habits will stand in good stead.   Be a dhira-strong, steady and deliberate.   Have unhurried pace of living.   Talk to yourself often.   These will uncover unknown frontiers inside yourself and help you to overcome any apparently wasteful dissipation and stabilise yourself.

Humans will think, \u201cOh, I really need to work on X.\u201d We don\u2019t work on X. We feel bad for not working on X. Repeat ad infinitum. That is, we practice that process. We humans get used to  expecting  to feel bad just by having a thought about accomplishing something.   Result? Feeling bad about not doing something feels like the right answer. It feels satisfying.   This is the basis of my general profile line:  There\u2019s nothing so comfortable as a familiar neurosis.   We modern humans tend to also practice feeling good about avoiding getting things done. As children we called it  recess  or even  getting away with it .   The repeated practice of feeling great for avoiding working on things, teaches humans to feel satisfied with \u201csuccessfully\u201d avoiding accomplishment.   Flip it around. Practice feeling good about doing something toward what you want to get done. Humans can train our brains to expect to get the satisfaction of accomplishment, not the satisfaction of a guilt trip or recess.   My favorite motivational hack is to remember the story about the \u201ctwo wolves\u201d inside of us, the good one and the bad one who are fighting each other inside of us all the time. Which one wins?   The one we feed.   Feed the good one. Practice doing rather than practice avoiding. We learn best what we practice most.   And the best part of this? You might be  avoiding  right now, but as soon as you become conscious of it, you can stop, and instead get something done.   Giving yourself a guilt trip about not cleaning the kitchen? Put away a couple dishes, instead. Feeling relief for playing instead of getting something done? Take a \u201cbreak\u201d from playing, and go work on something that will make you proud.   Avoidance becomes an addiction.   We practice it.   My best motivational hack is to remember, and to immediately act on it before I can fall into the habit of avoiding: We learn best what we practice most.   I remember that I want to practice accomplishment, not recess. That\u2019s my hack.   I\u2019m going to go exercise now.\n\nMy best motivational hack is to remember: We learn best what we practice most.

And then you start thinking, thinking about how to stop wasting time, and about how to get your life back on track.   Next day you Start saying No to every friend of yours who wants to take you out for party, and Start saying Yes to your work and to re-begin building your Future, to Start living that Dream again. And that\u2019s exactly how you Start to Motivate Yourself !!\n\nME. I am My Motivation. I am My Strength. I am My Power-House.   Motivation is found nowhere but inside of the body of the individual who needs it. The person who not only wants to but need to achieve something great in his\/her life. When you are that much concerned about your life, and when you really need to reach somewhere, when you really want to live the life that you have always dreamt of, then the Strength comes from inside.

Whenever I remain down and I feel disinterested, I get to my mother lap and sleep there and have a conversation with her after which she let me to understand that anything can be done but it require time as well as patience. Some takes less time where as some take much time. The point of thinking only makes the difference.   One should first of all change the manner of thinking. One should have to do something which brings positivity to them and they should remain consistent towards that activity in order to escape them from that bad ruts but yes it is a slow moving process and will definitely take time since it was with us from a very long time.   Another solution is to keep yourself in a room which has a totally bright light, the things of your interest, a diary, a pen, a shelf such that you will be in a mood to utilize all that in order to divert your mood from that nonsense stuffs.   Another solution is to start YOGA and MEDITATION for hours starting from few hours to long hours such that the manner of thinking and way of looking will totally change. This will also take some time if done with discipline and dedication.   Another solution is that by thinking positively and making yourself feel that you are the only person in the world who can be good to others, do good to others, can do everything, can help everyone, can bring some new ideas, can bring a change.   The last and most important is by keeping yourself busy in those things which give you something in return, make your mind cool, make you feel light, make you feel luckiest and etc.   Thank you !!   Hope it will help to a greater extent.\n\nHey, first of all thank you for giving me the opportunity to give answer to this question.

Then you think to yourself - how come everyone is killing it? How come I haven\u2019t had any significant achievement in the last 1\u20132\u20135 years? What\u2019s even an achievement for me? Am I worthy of doing anything? Whatever little I have achieved till now, was it just a fluke? The cloud of imposter gets so dark that the rays of confidence just won\u2019t reach me.   Dealing with such thoughts every single day, what keeps me going is messages like these: Words cannot even describe how I feel when I read messages like these. It's a beautiful feeling knowing that you're making someone\u2019s life better even for those few seconds when they\u2019re reading your answers, you're making their life better even if it's a tiny little bit.   And to everyone who's been feeling low lately: It\u2019s completely okay to feel low. It\u2019s completely okay to not be where your peers are. Everyone comes from a different background, a different life setup, and a different mindset, and hence everyone has a different story to tell. This is what makes each one of us different.

As is well known, the Japanese love fresh fish. Such has been Japan\u2019s fascination with eating fresh fish that, for many years now, there\u2019s hardly any fish to be found in the waters off Japanese shores. So fishermen came up with a solution. They built bigger boats and went farther from the shore to catch fish. Unfortunately, this created another problem. The farther they went to fish, the longer it took them to get back to the shore. By the time they got back, the fish was stale. And the Japanese, well, they like their fish fresh. To solve this problem, the fishermen came up with another solution. They installed refrigeration units on the boats. But the Japanese were clearly clever, discerning folks. They could tell the difference between frozen fish and fresh fish. And they wanted their fresh fish. Besides, frozen fish commanded lower prices, threatening the viability of the entire fishing business.   So the fishermen came up with another solution. They installed fish tanks on the boat! They would catch fish from the sea and put them into the tank. So they could now take back fresh fish!   But that was not to be either. As the tank got stuffed with fish, the fish would flap around a bit, then get lazy and lie resigned to their fate. Motionless. Inactive. Dull. And the Japanese could tell the difference. They wanted fresh fish, not sluggish fish!   Even as a seemingly insurmountable crisis loomed over the Japanese fishing industry, the wise fisherfolk came up with yet another innovative solution. They still had to sail out a long distance. And they still had the same boats and the same fish tanks. But there was one difference. In each tank, the fishermen put in a small shark. The shark kept the fish active, running around, busy. Sure, the shark ate a few fish but the threat of the shark kept the other fish active and healthy. The challenge ensured that none of them could afford to lie still. As a result, what eventually reached the shore was fresh, active fish. And the Japanese loved it!   We are like fish too. We need that shark to stay sharp. In case you or your organization is slowly slipping into the comfort zone, it may be a good idea to bring in a shark.   Remember, the shark may eat some fish but that\u2019s a small price to pay for keeping the rest of them active. Get your shark. Today!   Get out of the comfort zone.   If there\u2019s no enemy, create one. Small price to pay to keep yourself motivated!!   Set a purpose in your life, what you want to do in the next upcoming years, the target you set will itself suffice the motivation.   .   .   .   .   .   Another example from the same book.   Goals: The Secret to Making Your Dreams Come True True story? Not sure. But the story goes that in 1963, some behavioural scientists performed an experiment with the graduating class of Harvard Business School. They asked the students if they had written down goals for themselves. Their goals for life. For the future. On paper.   A mere 3 per cent of the class had actually written down goals. Yes. Just 3 per cent.   Well, twenty-five years later, the scientists again got in touch with the class of \u201963. To find out how they had done in their careers. And in their lives.   And guess what?   They found that the net worth of the 3 per cent of the class that had written down goals was MORE than the net worth of the rest of that batch. Not just that; the 3 per cent written-down-goalwallahs seemed to be happier, doing what they wanted and leading far more fulfilling lives.   Incredible. But, I believe, it\u2019s true. And it could be true for all of us.   What are your goals? What do you want to achieve? What do you want to be, have, do? In life. At work. In relationships. Whatever it be, write it down. Now. Just write it down. Not later, not tomorrow\u2014now!   And commit yourself to action.  Commit yourself to doing what it takes to achieve your goals. Take action. Make sure that everything you do is taking you closer to your goals. (If it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t do it.)   And finally, take a step today. However small it may be, but take that first step today. If you want to lose weight, walk that 45-minute walk\u2014today! If you want to be the best salesperson, make that extra sales call\u2014today!   You\u2019ll see the difference. As the Nike guys would say, just do it. It takes just  three steps.   Step   one :  Write down your goals.   Step   two :  Make a commitment to action, to doing what it takes.   Step   three :  Take the first step. Today!   Come on, make a beginning. You owe it to yourself. And you have nothing to lose.   .   .   .   .   What are your goals? What do you want to be, have, do? Whatever it be, write it down.   Now after you have decided your goals; it's like a difficult task just like a huge mountain to climb.  So another example. Climbing the mountain   If two people are trying to climb a mountain together, what\u2019s the most important thing they need to get to the top? Is it equipment? Or training? Or teamwork? Or favourable weather conditions?   Well, they need all of these for sure. But the most important thing is the mountain itself. They need a clear goal!   Too often, we get obsessed with the equipment and the training but have no clear goals. The best mountain-climbing equipment is of little use if you don\u2019t have a mountain to climb.   We are all very fortunate. We have the most fabulous equipment there is. We have access to training. And there are colleagues out there, waiting to help us succeed. But we need to have our own mountains. Our own goals.   And once you have your own mountain to climb, everything changes. Magically. You get a sense of purpose. You begin to want to climb that peak. You become disciplined. You get up early, you brave the cold, you watch your diet, you seek out experts, you read the books \u2026 All because you now have a mountain to climb. A peak to conquer.   So instead of complaining about your equipment or your training, and worrying about buying more sophisticated equipment, set your own goals first.   Find your own mountain. That could be the first step towards transforming your whole life.   Go ahead. Write down your goals. Today.   Get your own mountain. And take the first step towards feeling on top of the world.   The best mountain-climbing equipment is of little use if you don\u2019t have a mountain to climb. .   .   .   .   Sometimes it occurs that even after lot of hard work, we don't get any results, so here's a story called as  The Chinese Bamboo. The Chinese Bamboo   My favourite spot at home\u2014and my wife\u2019s pride and joy\u2014is a little palm-and-bamboo garden she\u2019s managed to create in the balcony of our apartment. So every morning, that\u2019s where we sit and devour the day\u2019s newspapers, with some freshly brewed south Indian filter coffee making the news seem just a wee bit more interesting!   And it\u2019s probably this new patch of green that sparked off my interest in the Chinese bamboo. A tree that grows really tall\u2014to a height of over eighty feet. It takes around five years and three months to grow to its full height. But here\u2019s the interesting bit. For the first five years after you plant the seed, you see nothing. Absolutely nothing. Except perhaps a little shoot springing out of the bulb and struggling to make a squiggle.   And then, in the next ninety days, it shoots up to a towering eighty feet.   Can you believe it? For the first sixty months, all the growth is invisible, below the surface. The Chinese bamboo\u2019s roots create a complex network, like a miniature version of the London Underground. It is these strong roots that, when fully developed, help support a tree that will soar above all else.   And in the next ninety days\u2014yes, merely ninety days\u2014it literally takes off. And becomes as tall as an eight-storeyed building.   In this era of instant coffee and fast food, of get-rich-quick schemes and lose-weight-quicker regimens, of quarterly earnings and month-on-month growth, perhaps we all need to pause and take a lesson from the Chinese bamboo.   Patience has its reward. Nothing of substance happens in a jiffy. All too often, we are unwilling to wait for the pay-off, and tend to settle for shorter trees.   Having sown the seed and having initiated something, when we don\u2019t see results, we get impatient. We keep pulling out the sapling to check if the roots are growing. (Well, when you do that, they don\u2019t!)   As leaders and bosses, we tend to be impatient for results. And often, too often, we rush to reward the mushrooms that spring up after one spectacular rainy night (and wither away soon after)\u2014only because we can see them! Long-term, sustainable successes take time, and a good question to ask yourself is whether your leadership style encourages\u2014or even allows\u2014the growth of the Chinese bamboo. Or are you creating an organization of stunted, but quickly visible trees?   Every major achievement is almost always preceded by years of toil, hard work, failure, stress, tests of character, determination, sleepless nights \u2026 All of which help form the network of roots that can then support real accomplishments. And eighty-feet-tall trees.   So the next time you feel frustrated by lack of results and want to give up, don\u2019t. Think of the Chinese bamboo.   When you feel the world is unjust and is refusing to recognize your hard work and your commitment, don\u2019t panic. Five years of subterranean activity will almost always be followed by three months of meteoric rise.   And ah, yes, after years of slogging it out in relative obscurity, when you finally achieve success, be prepared for people to say: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s so lucky. He\u2019s become an overnight success!\u2019   If only they knew about the Chinese bamboo! Patience has its reward. Nothing of substance happens in a jiffy. Thanks for reading!!

It is a vital component which allows human beings to adapt, function effectively and maintain healthy life outcomes in the face of adversity. Motivation may be extrinsic (external) or intrinsic (internal) in nature. The former rests on external rewards which lead to desired consequences, for instance, a salary hike motivates an employee to enhance their performance. Intrinsic motivation rests on personal satisfaction and is rooted in the experience of flow. This means that these activities are self-contained as performing them can be rewarding in itself.\n\nMotivation helps to ignite action for desired goals. It allows us to plan and execute.

This means stopping herself from grabbing attention of others.   At that time she liked it as a compliment. But now, she's getting why it was not just that.   As she started to know her boyfriend, she would find mostly such girls on his social profiles that he did not like. You are seeing the double standards here, right?   Because of him, Ruby had changed herself a lot due to which she had lost her identity. She wore the short dresses out of her comfort zone, clicked pictures in the aesthetic poses to please him.   This was definitely a red flag.   She's lucky to get rid of him at an early stage.   .   Now the thing which I wanted to highlight here is not only the impact he had on Ruby.   There is a bigger picture residing behind. It's about your self identity.   Have you ever noticed?   When we lack emotional maturity and rational thinking we keep finding our inspiration in people who we think are cool as per societal standards.   Who are these people to decide if you're looking gorgeous in a bodycon dress or ugly in a baggy t-shirt?   Who are these people to judge if you're a soft girl or a tomboy?   Isn't your close bonds are meant to accept you the way you are? No matter what.   Actually it's not about wearing modern or being desi. You can rock in both.   It is all about your authenticity and comfort.   My request to you is that don't look at others, do things according to yourself.   What looks good on you and what you like is a total game changer. Trust me!   Learn to love and own your skin proudly, so that no one else can make you feel insecure about yourself.   It's your life, you don't have to live it to anyone else's expectations. \u0935\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0916\u0942\u092c\u0938\u0942\u0930\u0924 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u0902\u0938\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u091a\u0947\u0939\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902,   \u092f\u0947 \u0935\u0947\u0936-\u092d\u0942\u0937\u093e \u0916\u093e\u092e\u0916\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0926\u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0948\u0964\n\nI know a girl whom I talked to a few days ago.

I was born on 30th October, 1999 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. My family included Me, My elder sister, Mom & Dad. We lived in a 2-BHK flat.   On the morning of 26th January 2001 (when I was about 15 months old)  at about 10 a.m., there was a sudden shift in the house. It seemed as if everything had moved suddenly. People from the neighbourhood were screaming and everyone was rushing to get out of the house.  Yes, It was an earthquake!   My parents took time to understand what was happening actually but as soon as they realised, they rushed towards the entrance. My father took my 5 year old sister in his lap whereas my mother carried me in her lap. Both of them rushed down to get out of the building and manage to reach the border of the parking.  Just then, the building collapsed.   A couple of hours later, few people were removed from under the collapsed building leaving those who got buried deep within and had left no trace at all. My father and sister were removed on the same day itself.  My father had severe injuries and underwent several surgeries from the top surgeons of India. Till date, he had about 50 surgeries. He took several years to recover although not completely. One part of his body is almost non-functioning.  He can walk properly but cannot write with his right hand.  My sister, when removed was found dead.   After about 5 days of the accident, I and my mother were removed. The army engineers shouted if there was someone still inside when my mother responded. They asked if there was someone along with her. She said that she had her child along with her. She demanded water as soon as possible. Water was delivered by inserting a pipe through a small hole.  Army engineers dug further to widen up the hole. I was removed from the hole and then my mother.  My mother fed me soil to keep me alive.   We were taken to the hospital immediately where my mother asked for my father and my sister. She was not told about anything at that moment. My mother had her toenail cut permanently and I had a permanent bone crook in my left leg.  The necessary treatments were made. We moved temporarily at my grandmother\u2019s house till the government provided us with the house to live in for around two years. We\u2019d lost everything in the accident. We struggled somehow for two years with frequent visits to Mumbai for my father\u2019s surgeries.  Our apartment was rebuilt after the earthquake but my mother refused to live there.  We gave the apartment for rent for a few years and lived at another rented apartment.   I underwent one surgery where my leg got fixed to a remarkable extent but it is not normal.   When I look back, Many thoughts come to my mind: Why did it all happen to me? Why did God kill my sister? What if I had died instead of my sister? There\u2019s a single answer to every question that pops up.  It has all happened to make me strong.   I\u2019m really grateful to be alive today and I\u2019m proud of the person I\u2019ve become. I keep improving myself everyday & whenever I feel like giving up, I tell myself that I\u2019m alive today for a reason.  I could have died but I\u2019m alive to contribute something to the world.   That incident has added a meaning to my life.  I started writing about 2 years ago and a significant number of people have benefited from my answers. It feels great to help people and I look forward to continue this for my entire life. I will spend my life researching about happiness and success in people\u2019s lives and increasing it to a great extent. The point in the answer is that, You are alive for a reason. You could have died in any of the accidents that happened till date but you did not. It is because you are given an opportunity to do something that improves world a bit. The fact that,  A 7.7 magnitude of earthquake did not kill me means that I\u2019m alive to make something remarkable  motivates me in life.

Said' you would be arrested if any one complains about child labour. Are you not ashamed bringing such a small boy for work? He should be in school'.   They replied \u2018from the childhood he likes this carpentry things. He won't even go out to play with his friends!\u2019   My lion was there reading paper. I was busy inside cooking. I found this scene interesting. I faced same situations in Bangalore. I was curious to know how my lion would tackle it.   I thought today she got a nice educated prey! Haha.   She called her and said ' Indu!( Her name) who said carpentry is not education?   That girl fumbled!   \u2018No Baamma Garu! It's essential, he should have basic education in schools. Otherwise he would be exploited later. He would suffer!\u2019   I could see the grin in the boy's dad and uncle\u2019s face!   My lion called' Bhadram! ( Carpenter's name ) Come here! How many days you took to start our work?   He grinned sheepishly! \u2018Why all that now Amma! Papagaru! Meerellandi!( Young girl , please leave).   My lion really roared. \u2018Feeling shy? I would tell! Three months! Always say busy doing apartment's work. Doesn't have time to attend this small piece of work.\u2019   you talk of exploitation. People who doesn't have any skills would get exploited. It's his fate. Not the one who mastered the trade! World is not fair. Only Vidya ( knowledge ) is respected in any form!\u2019   \u2018When did your brother-in-law learn this carpentry? My lion asked him.   \u2018After my 20 th year! Amma! I joined ITI. Later I came to this field.His brother in law replied.   \u2018You didn't learn while studying? My mil asked him'.   He scratched his head with pencil and kept it back of his ear.replied..   \u2018No Amma! My father said. This is a difficult job, you study well and become a govt officer! So till I finish my degree I didn't learn.\u2019   \u2018Could you become an officer?   \u2018If I could, how you could find me here? He chuckled.   \u2018Why? Why you couldn't?   \u2018I don't have that inclination ' he replied so casually.\u2019!   \u2018Speak truth! My mil chided!   \u2018I get 18000 maximum per month'! Too less! I could earn more in this! He sheepishly agreed!   \u2018This degree and your ITI didn't help at all? That girl asked in an accusing tone.   \u2018ITI was of a little help Akka! But not this degree! I have lost some time unnecessarily in college. Hope there should be dedicated colleges for carpentry. There are a few I heard but beyond our reach. He replied in a disappointed voice.\u2019   \u2018That's why I made my brother in law to understand this and bringing my nephew along with us when ever he is free. His elder brother is not interested in carpentry. He is staying in hostel and studying. He does not want this sounds and dust. He feels it's disturbance.   \u2018You know Amma! This little fellow is expert in fixing \u2018door stoppers!!   He is very proud of his nephew!! Smiled looking at that boy with love.   \u2018Shall I tell you one thing Amma! Bank loans and all ate difficult for us to get . That's why we are encouraging this fellow to have basic degree. Need not be a topper. It's not useful and time waste for him. Evening he would go to my elder brother. He would teach him how to measure and filing. So with basic degree he would become perfectly trained carpenter'.   I urgently started looking for non existing hibiscus flowers to pluck from the plant in our compound !!!   'I know the next scene! Barbecue grill!!   My lion turned to the girl. \u2018Now you understood? Only college education is not education. Now this boy is cleverly utilising his time. His dad, his uncles are not teachers?   Of late you people started making everything an issue. You won't let any child learn his trade. No skills at all.   Better you concentrate on bonded labour! Forcebly tortured kids. don't try to see everything through your coloured glasses and with bird's brain.   All sports people are trained from their childhood. You have no issues. If a mason, a carpenter, a plumber, train the kids it would become an issue and you sloganeer and agitate , it's branded as child labour'!   \u2018You people don't have guts to open your mouth really where children are getting exploited and used as child labour. Because they are done by powerful people. But ready to use a \u2018Brahmasthram on a tiny sparrow!!   \u2018Other day that boy was working with his dad's elder brother. Some one like you complained. Full-day is gone for them roaming around police station. They say except with his father he is not supposed to work with anyone. If he does, it comes under child labour. What kind of people you are? What kind of rules these are?   \u2018Wth just degree certificate what he should do? He could use it as a tongue cleaner! That's it!   If he learnt something atleast he can live on his own.otherwise with bank loan he would open some shop related to his carpentry. Like hinges, handles, laminations, etc what it is called? She asked..   \u2018Plywood shop! The boy replied with a twinkle in his eyes !!   \u2018See him! He knows!! My mil smiled.   \u2018What about you? Next year you would finish degree. Which office you are joining?   The girl murmured something.   \u2018Think atleast from now onwards! instead of blaming govt, parents, teachers, society, politicians, finally God tomorrow !! My lion tore her to pieces!!   I showered my sympathy looks on that poor girl!!   The discussion can be pulled in to any direction!! Let us leave it there!   I rushed inside to finish my cooking.   ~~~~   Now that boy is 26 years. Had his work shop. His dad, uncles and others are working in that. They are making customised furniture and service. Small jobs also they are taking up in an organised way. Like.. giving a particular time frame. Finishing it in that time and it's maintenance. In between taking wood work contracts also. They have decent earnings.settled in a respected way.The boy\u2019s brother settled in Hyderabad, doing some job.   I didn't ask about his income in Hyderabad. I know this boy\u2019s income would be much more than that. Ever green and no retirement.   When I met that boy recently, he said he wants to teach interested youngesters by joining them as apprentices under experienced carpenters in holidays and free time.   What is the way to make life happy? Question your self what you want in life. 2. Realise , in which things you are the best.   3. How to reach and become that best. The way to reach it.   These three things only would make your life happy.   whatever you do ,have clarity. If you don't have, ask your parents. They know your capacity and capability from your childhood.   They would guide you.   Not by comparing with others.   Not by competing with others.   Not by participating in a rat race.   You would be happy only by knowing what you are and what you want. Then work for it.\n\nI argue less with my MGM lion. That makes her happy. My life happy and peaceful too!! Hahaha.   There was a carpenter's kid. Studying 5 th standard.

He calls my Son by my Brother\u2019s name. He knows what he\u2019s trying to say, but his brain won\u2019t comply. He gets confused.   My Father will be 93 on June 8.   He fought in WWII, drafted into battle at the tender age of 19. His troop helped liberate the concentration camp in Dachau, Germany. He witnessed unimaginable grief, coupled with breathtakingly triumphant relief. A cannon went off near where he was stationed, and he permanently lost hearing in his left ear. Currently, his right ear is probably 20% at best, and that\u2019s with a hearing aid that is constantly lost.   He has had 2 open heart surgeries, an aortic valve replacement, a pacemaker and a few stents put in.   His fingers are so twisted up with arthritis, it\u2019s hard to believe he used to play the violin in a symphony orchestra.   His reflexes are impaired, so we took his Driver\u2019s License away several years ago to help him and everyone else be safe on the road.   His back aches from spinal stenosis, so we put in a chair lift to help him be safe going up and down the staircase.   My Mother prepares a pillbox every Sunday evening that consists of that week\u2019s daily dose of myriad medications that he needs to take at varying intervals.   He knows he\u2019s losing his mind. He\u2019s also well aware that his wife, my mother, the woman he\u2019s been married to for the past 63 years, is losing her patience in dealing with him.   I can only imagine how frustrating each day must be for him. It\u2019s disheartening and sad for me.   :(   Yet, every morning, my Father takes that chair lift down the stairs.   He makes a pot of coffee for my Mother, who will wake up 2 hours later and come downstairs to drink it.   He walks outside to the driveway, bends down to pick up the New York Times and puts it on the kitchen table for her to read while she\u2019s sips her hot brew.   He cuts himself a slice of perfectly ripe cantaloupe and after he puts the spoon up to his mouth and swallows a bite, he exhales an audible, \u201c Mmmmmm \u201d in delight.   He answers my phone calls, and tells me about what he did yesterday. While his sentences are a bit jumbled and difficult to follow, they are peppered with words like, \u201c Marvelous \u201d and \u201c Fantastic \u201d.   My Father is not sad.   He is happy for every single day that he has the ability to take that chair lift down the stairs. He\u2019s grateful to be able to walk out to the driveway to pick up the paper, to pick up the telephone to talk with me, and to pick up that perfectly ripe spoonful of cantaloupe.   He has always shown tremendous gratitude for life\u2019s small pleasures. It adds up to a large amount of happiness, and a beautiful, long existence on this planet.

The most sure way to kill your happiness is to watch horror movies. Avoid them at any cost. They\u2019re no good for your soul. Happiness is highly contagious. Find happy friends and inflict them with laughter\u2014and get stuck with them. Find a good reason to be happy, and hang onto it like your life depended on it. Move to a place where people are happy, or move to a place where people want to be happy. Eat chocolate. Scientists tell us that eating dark chocolate actually works chemically to improve our moods. Dark   chocolate contains compounds that stimulate endorphins, the same compounds that are released after you exercise or laugh. Now you know. Avoid arguments, quarrels and bitterness. They only poison your mood. Team up with a bunch of happy people, or form a \u2018happy club\u2019\u2014you\u2019ll never be sad. Do you love listening to music? You should. It soothes your nerves. If you don\u2019t, I pity you. Fend off negative thoughts, and negative feelings. They only add to your misery. Cultivate positive vibes. Most of you will not like this\u2014stop watching porn. Doesn\u2019t make you happy. You end up masturbating\u2014which drains you from the inside-out. Meditate and listen to soothing, calming, relaxing, and spiritual music. Many people will not agree with me, but hard rock or heavy metal music kills your peace. Just decide to be happy. You don\u2019t need a formula or the psychology of happiness to be happy. There\u2019s no formula for happiness. Whenever you feel sad, just take a deep breath 3 times and breathe out slowly. Release your sadness and anger as you breathe out. This works more than a thousand other formulas. Take a jog or walk your dog. If you don\u2019t have a dog, jog anyway. Fresh air is rich in oxygen\u2014which injects new life into your system. Forgive everyone who has ever offended you, but more importantly forgive yourself. Don\u2019t take your sweet sleep for granted. Doctors recommend 6 - 8 hours of sleep per day. Biologically, there are nutrients which can only be manufactured when you\u2019re asleep. The longer the sleep the more the nutrients produced. If you have a flower garden, tend it regularly. Flowers emit a healing scent. Greet people as they pass, including your neighbors. Find an excuse to laugh by cracking a joke. [Photo Credit: Unsplash]\n\nDon't take life too seriously.

Being unhappy, disappointed, sad, frustrated and upset is  easy . Yes, no matter how harsh it sounds, people find it more  comfortable  to stay in the \u201cdark zone\u201d.  Staying happy involves hard core efforts .   Every human likes to stay comfortable, no one likes work. When they find themselves unhappy, they tend to look for every and any reason possible to pin the blame on. They never realize that the  source and solution  to all their problems lie within their own selves.   For example,   You are financially weak, blame it on your parents for not leaving an inheritance (instead of working your ass off and creating a legacy for yourself.)   You are fat, blame it on your inability to wake up in the mornings and excercise (instead of sleeping an hour early, setting up an alarm, and consciously make and effort to WAKE UP!)   You are insecure about your looks, blame it on your \u201cnot so good genes\u201d and keep doing what you have been doing for ages! (instead of wearing good clothes, grooming up and having a firm belief that you  DESERVE  to look good. Not everyone looks good as it is, it requires  efforts !)   I hope I\u2019ve made my point clear here.   Happiness requires efforts . Hence, people tend to avoid it and stay in the comfort zone of insecurity and all the negative emotions possible!   You want to be happy, work hard for it. Dig deep withing yourself, you\u2019ll find the answers to all your problems!\n\nWell, the answer is very simple.   \u201c You need to care enough to make it happen .\u201d   There is no one way to make and keep your life happy.

Indulge yourself in meaningful and intellectual conversations. Gain knowledge. Push yourself. Do things out of your comfort zone. Having a fun attitude towards life keeps the heart healthy. Sometimes keeping aside the mature you, do some cute activities. Life is too short to act mechanical always.   Hope is that ray of light amid darkness. Hope keeps you alive. Don't weigh yourself down in negative thoughts. Even if things don't go the way you want, always do hope for the better.   Take your relationships seriously. Never take your loved ones for granted. They are the only ones who will still stick to you in your bad times. I'm sure no one wants to be in such a situation where you achieve milestones in life but don't have genuine people to clap for you. Trust me, that situation is the worst situation in anyone's life.   Don't take stress. Stress is very harmful for both physical and mental health. It showly and steadily finishes the person.   Take care of your physical health. Exercise. Stay hydrated. Eat right food. Nothing feels okay in life when you're ill.   Enjoy and celebrate every moment of life no matter how small they are. The celebrations of these moments are the reason why we want to live more. Life is very beautiful if you see the positive and brighter side of it.   Spread love, happiness and positivity. Make this world a kinder place to live. What goes around comes around. It will surely come back to you as well.   \u2764\ufe0f\n\nHappiness is a state of mind.

Because as I said it was No. And it was not \u201ca one day thing\u201d , there has been a constant tiny heartbreaks.   It happens when we are used to getting treated a certain way, we feel a void when that doesn't happen and obviously that will lead to feeling extremely sad.   No points for guessing, I have always kept my favourite people above than my self respect.   While that happened I realised something,  why are we making things so complicated ? Why  is it that our mood and our happiness is being decided by another person .   Let's say the person is not treating the way they used to, maybe they have changed for certain reasons and so that it effecting you,  the crux is ,it's you who is allowing them to bother your mental peace, not them, not their behaviour .   See, i had been through such behaviours before as well when I sum them all there's a very strong message that I receive in the end that being; \u201cIf they want to, if they care, they will show, they will be there\u201d And that's it, it makes everything so simple and life happier  . You don't have to hustle for getting someone's attention the way you want,or the way it was before , there's hell lot to hustle for , and it doesn't have to be a human atleast.   That is exactly what makes life very simple and easy. If I had to summarise Stop giving people unnecessary importance treat them as they do Don't let anyone else control your mood Hold you own accountability ,rather than relying on anyone else And most importantly, it's your life, you are the centre of it, you are responsible for everything single sorrow and every single Happiness, nothing entres your life without your consent .

However, we perceive them as a source of joy and abuse and add unnecessary stress to our minds.   Such happiness derived from matter is corrupt and low quality; it doesn't sustain itself and loses its ground soon after separation or later out of boredom. It leaves you in a never-ending cycle of more and better. A little deviation from it makes you restless, weak and sad.   I considered the mountains my source of happiness, but every other day, especially under little stress, I would feel incomplete and sad because I wasn't in the mountains. That notion didn't help me, and I changed my perception. I still love the mountains but don't consider them my source of happiness.   Happiness is a state of feeling united with your soul, where you become indifferent to the outside world, you realize your identity above any material, emotion or stimuli, and know that the reasons for worry aren't worldly subjects but your emotional association with them; it\u2019s your choice of making them the cause of pain and attachment.   You realize that you have been granted a body to live a story, to see a variety of circumstances, to use your mind and wisdom to act, follow the path of bravery and righteousness. You can't afford to be attached to anything present here; attachment is the source of grief.   Life is a beautiful garden; gardens have flowers, trees, thorny bushes, insects, grass, mud, and reptiles. You are not here to touch, smell, pluck and take every flower with you; you are not here to remove every reptile or insect; you can't remove all the thorny bushes; you can't only expect the shade of trees all around.   You have been given an entry; walk in the garden, relish diverse experiences and walk away with memories and wisdom. That's your ultimate destiny; you can't keep that garden in your pocket or own it. Doesn't matter how beautiful a flower is; it belongs to the garden and not you; it doesn't matter if a deadly snake lives in the garden; it can't hang on to you; you would indeed walk away without it, so why fear it?   Feel happy because you are in the garden for a while.   Feel free from attachment to its matter; just enjoy the visit.   Your soul doesn't care, isn't affected, and can't feel hurt or broken; your feelings and attachment towards worldly matters give you all the negative emotions.   Be determined to stay free, casual and happy and keep doing righteous deeds, each day, each moment, without expecting something in return.   Circumstances, people, and failures can't hurt you; they hurt your expectations; they hurt your ego, the fake identity of 'me' being the owner of life.   Stop owning life, be free, and don't take the chairman's seat, be the manager. Let the almighty universe, nature and soul be the chairman. Let them take the responsibility of owning, and you keep running.   Neither consider yourself the doer nor try to adjust the modus operandi of life and nature.   You don't die in a movie theatre because the lead actor died; however, if you closely connect with them, you feel excruciating pain in your heart. However, those who watch it as an entertaining movie with a realization that it's just a movie won't feel intense emotions and unnecessary emotional pain. They may not enjoy the film as much as others but stay disconnected and free.   We lower our standards by restricting and limiting ourselves to a body relying on physical matter to survive and attain happiness.   You never say that you own your room, you claim the ownership of your house, and here you claim to own only the furniture.   Happiness is a state of existence, being alive, active and conscious of the world. Happiness is in relishing the diverse experiences of life, happiness is in feeling excited about the turns and twists of life, happiness is in realizing that no pain is permanent and no subject matter can give you ultimate satisfaction, happiness is in being free and still doing your best and feeling good about your deeds.   Prioritize your real deeper self over nature and the world.

It\u2019s filled with images of luxury cars, exotic vacations, and designer clothes. However, what these carefully curated snapshots often fail to reveal is the financial burden behind the scenes. You see the brand new car but not the \u20b910 to \u20b915 lakh car loan. You see the nice vacation pictures but not the \u20b91,00,000 credit card debt. You see the housewarming pics, but not the rate of interest and home loan behind it.

I concluded at the end, maybe I could make my life happy by trying what others are doing for their happiness . I studied hard, worked hard and tried to achieve many things. It was not easy for me to achieve everything that I wanted. For my perfect happiness, there were too many things to achieve.\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22  Comparing my ability to what I wanted in my life, there was too much gap .  But my pride did not allow for me to accept it. There were achievement in my life that people envy a lot, but they were nothing for me.  Devoid of fulfillment....\u2026 For All the things I had, I took it as granted. What I did not have, no matter what that is, made me to feel great anger and jealousy.   I eventually got depression.  I heard about meditation when I got through a lot.   There was actually a method to throw way all the root causes make me not to be happy.  There was fake mind which is Karma habit and body in my mind.  I threw all of them away through meditation.  I realized that it was impossible to be happy with this fake mind.  Because this fake & false mind is mind of hunger and greed, there was no happiness.  From my mind,  I threw away even my false self who has all the fake mind. After that, I found my real mind, my original mind, which is Truth. This Truth is everlasting, never changing, and living existence.  This is the mind of universe. I had enlightenment that I don\u2019t need to pursue happiness anymore!  Since I have Truth within me, I find my complete & true self. I am just always happy!

It\u2019s almost evening. Birds have already started to return their nest before fading away from the complete daylight.   Life became stagnant here. An old Buddhist monk was explaining to me the importance of following a disciplined lifestyle. Suddenly, I asked him, \u201cBhante (Venerable Sir), how to become happy in life? He smiled with his calm and quiet mind, put his soft hands to my shoulder and told \u201cSon, leave unquenchable desire and ego from life\u201d   I was impressed by his dazzling and enthralling words in the brutal darkness of that evening. But I was not fully convinced. So, I decided to do an experiment.   Consequently, I explored, learn new things, meditated more than 1000 hours, left social media, strictly avoid online chatting, discussed with several religion people and atheists, read different religion scripts and hundreds of self-help books, helping people, feel the sufferings of people while working in slum areas, trying to lead a monk life for few days.   I experienced several momentum things in life. From my experience, I can share that there are 9 ways to make life happy-   1.Spread self-less love, tenderness, and happiness instead of expecting love from someone:  My close observation is that, \u201cmost of the people in the world want to get love and desire to date with the beautiful person. People are happy when someone takes care of them. But that\u2019s not real happiness. The real happiness relies on spreading love and kindnesses among people who are deprived of this from life. There are lots of children and underprivileged people in the world who has been brought up without love and affection. Extend your helping hand and service for humanity. Do social or voluntary works at least once in a week. Basically spreading love is the pre-requisite of happiness. This selfless love will fill your heart with joy, satisfaction, and radical changing in your mind.   2. Deep down in the mystery of mind:  You may have everything like astounding physique, excellent career, beautiful and caring spouse, adorable kids, Lamborghini car and a nice house. But still, you are unhappy about life. Ultimately, you are stressed and worried all the time with the challenges of life. Why does it happen? Why do we feel empty despite having everything in life?   The answer is very simple. You are unhappy because you did not deep down in the mystery of the mind. The ultimate happiness comes from drowning in the mystery of mind. The way is very na\u00efve such as meditating, deep breathing for a few minutes and practice yoga to search happiness inside the mind. Let\u2019s simplify the process. Sit on bed or floor, stop all the thoughts, disconnect your monkey mind from the other world, calm your mind, close eyes, take a deep breath and observe your breath. Regular 5-10 minutes practice will help to achieve self-control, undisturbed mind and intense happiness.   3. Paying attention to the significant value of taking care of our body and health:  Ambiguous lifestyle will make your life extremely difficult. If you are young, your body will tolerate all the junk food or fast food; skip morning breakfast, go to bed late in the night, and avoid physical exercise.   But your body will start to lose grip slowly it\u2019s when you will become 30 plus. Sooner or later you will be affected with various problems like Diabetes, cholesterol problem, blood pressure, digest problem, headache, and back pain and so on. Proper diet, disciplined lifestyle, emphasize on morning breakfast, consume less amount red meat, considerate amount of physical exercise, eating a bowl of salad or fresh fruit regularly will help to fit your body. Success, money, and fame is meaningless unless you don\u2019t have a sound body and health to enjoy this thing. Being good health is pivotal for achieving happiness in life.   4. Excluding the materialistic happiness from life:  One of my friends told in university presentation, three things gave him ultimate happiness and joy. A brand new i-phone, Porsche car, and Rolex wrist watch. He had a wrong perspective about life. It\u2019s a materialistic happiness. You will never satisfy your insatiable desires.   We cannot ignore the importance of money. But we will not obsess on money and other materialistic possessions. Obsessions on money and materials will simply ruin our life. Beware of it. The more you will ignore the materialistic happiness of life, the more you will be a happy person.   5. Being ordinary lifestyle is the key to become an extraordinary and happy person:  You are successful and have billions of dollars; it does not mean that you will waste millions of dollar to lead an expensive or fancy lifestyle, change millions of dollars cars frequently, and purchase a luxurious yacht, numerous houses. If you want to truly happy person, don\u2019t chase over these things. That\u2019s an illusion. This illusion and extravagant mentality will encourage you to spend more money on these things. Don\u2019t be trapped.   Live simple lifestyle, spend money which is required to spend, save or invest money wisely, and donate money, establish educational institutions, give scholarship to poor children who wants to study but don\u2019t have financial capability to go school, don\u2019t show off your surrounding people that you are rich and take conscious effort to behave more responsibly in online and offline.   If you are not rich, that\u2019s not a problem. At the end of the day, being rich should not be our target. Work hard, chase your passion and utilize every minutes of your life. The main goal of our life should be a good human being who can use his massive power and wealth for not leading a luxurious lifestyle. Instead, he or she will use all these to make the world a better place. This kind of lifestyle will lead us to the road of happiness.   6.Stay foolish, stay humble and down-to-earth person:  Why are you so arrogant? Do you know everything? Are you immortal? Do you have arrogance for your successful academic career, job or business or high status in society?   Arrogant and egoistic people will never be happy in life. Always ready to learn new things. Stay foolish, ask for help and prepare to achieve new skill and embrace new ideas. Well, you have achieved something in life. From your experience, you can help other people to reach their goal. You must stay humble and down-to-earth person because that\u2019s the power of a great virtue of human being. Help people as more as you can.   Stay foolish and stay humble all the time, that\u2019s the way you will able to adopt an amazing change in life. Life becomes easy, simple but it will have lots of fun.   7.Accept the fact that sufferings and grief are part of life:  As a human being, we cannot run away from sufferings, agony, sorrowfulness, heartbreak, and grief of our life.   It\u2019s an unpleasant truth of life that lots of tragic things may happen to us. Your parents will die, you will mess up in your relationship, failed to get the desired job, don\u2019t find an investor to fund for your amazing start-up project and you will miserably fail in life.   Everybody wants to accept happiness in life but I have found only a few people who are ready to accept the sufferings of life. So, from today, accept all types of negativity and misery of life. If we are not ready for these things, when an unusual accident happens in our life, we will be stressed, physically and mentally broken.   Basically, all sorrowfulness, rejection, sufferings, distress, and affliction make us stronger and help to achieve and realize the importance of happiness in life. That\u2019s why to consider sufferings as an integral part of life which will make you more relaxed and happy in near future.   8. Abolishing selfishness and jealousy from your character:  Have you ever asked yourself why do you upload your lots of pictures on social media? Why do you give a check in on facebook or upload snaps in Instagram during travel? Why do you share your achievements in social media? The answer is that you are narcissistic. Our all activities are self-centered. You want to show off and brag about your success and you are an attention seeker. You seek validation from other people for your achievement. Truly successful don\u2019t need to share their achievements in social media.   Interestingly, we feel uneasy when we listen about other people\u2019s success or feel clumsy when we see the amazing achievement or success of our friends while scrolling in social media feed. We are jealous. Jealousy is some sorts of thing where we drink the poison and expect that other people will die. But ultimately you will die by the effect of your jealousy.   The earlier you will get rid of selfishness and jealousy, the better things will start to happen with you very soon. Congratulate your friends, colleagues or relatives for their success. Pray for them. Suddenly you will start to feel better; your action plan will be changed. You will feel the power of life and happiness with a clean and broader mind.   9. Prepare an enlighten outlook for life:  Alter your perspective about life. We have to build our mind exceptionally strong way that we can control our reaction to whatever happens with us. You can get an amazing achievement or face massive failures in life.   But your mind level will be constant in any situation. Don\u2019t be over-excited after getting success or don\u2019t be over panicked or fearful after failure. Grateful for everything that you have achieved in life. Take it easy, smile as nothing has happened.   But how will I achieve this mindfulness to become steady and relaxed mind despite having great success or failure? It\u2019s not easy but not impossible. Consistent self-talk, autosuggestion, positive thinking, spiritual knowledge, disciplined life style, put away your distractions, avoiding excess alcohol and smoking, control the vast mind power by meditation and yoga will help to achieve these enlighten outlook for life.   Life is a gift, feel it. Our time is limited here. Enjoy life, go out of nature, make friends at every day, live with full of bean, work for your passion, focus on some amazing relationship in life instead of amassing wealth obsessively, release stress by a deep breath and devote yourself for humanitarian and philanthropist work. You will experience the real happiness even before the death because you will feel contented that you have done everything in life what you should have done. That\u2019s an unwavering and true happiness. Photo Credit :  Sights of B&R (4)\n\nI was feeling the heart-wrenching pin drop silence on Hilltop Golden temple in Bandarban, Bangladesh.

It has just 5 basic rules: Happiness is comparative:  If you were living in 1500s as the only 25 year old man in a village of 50 people, you'd feel as if you're absolutely stunning, as most other men would be too old, or too young, or scarred, or unfit. If you're a 25 year old man living in 2018 in a village of 50 people, you'll not compare yourself to the villagers, but to the movie stars and actors that you see on television and advertisments. Hence, by nothing changing in your looks, you'll still feel objectively uglier and dissatisfied with yourself. Happiness can't be m Continue Reading Understand happiness. It has just 5 basic rules: Happiness is comparative:  If you were living in 1500s as the only 25 year old man in a village of 50 people, you'd feel as if you're absolutely stunning, as most other men would be too old, or too young, or scarred, or unfit. If you're a 25 year old man living in 2018 in a village of 50 people, you'll not compare yourself to the villagers, but to the movie stars and actors that you see on television and advertisments. Hence, by nothing changing in your looks, you'll still feel objectively uglier and dissatisfied with yourself. Happiness can't be measured by objective parameters:  If you lived in 2011 in Egypt, you were likely revolting against the oppressive regime. But objectively speaking, if you were in the exact same place 500 years ago, the chances of your dying of hunger or disease or violence were much higher. You should have been out celebrating the regime. But you were dissatisfied, and no amount of objective graphs showing you that you should technically be happy would bring you happiness living under an oppressive regime. Happiness can't be bought:  Sure, you need enough money to be able to survive. If you're making 50000 USD a year, making 100000 would remove a lot of your worries. Being able to buy a house, being able to afford insurance, not having to worry about how to pay the school fee for your kids, money shall erode much of your problems. But if you're making 1 million USD a year and suddenly start making 2 million, it likey won't bring you any long-term happiness, even though the percentage of change is the same. Happiness is not short term:  If you break a leg permanently in an accident today, you'll be sad. But as long as your condition doesn't deteriorate, you'll get used to it, and soon your happiness levels would come back to the same as before the accident. Same thing with winning a lottery - you'll buy yourself things that you'll get used to pretty quickly, and your happiness levels would be the same as before the win. Happiness is subjective:  If you're a rock-star with millions of fans, you may still be much more depressed and suicidal than a simple guy having a simple job and living in a simple family. If you're currently dissatisfied with your job, and the economy tanks and you're left jobless for a year, you'll be very happy to get the same job back. If you're sad about the current state of your body, and then get cancer and recover from it, you'll be happy to achieve the same very body. Your happiness ultimately depends on you and you alone, and while others can influence it, you're the only one that can truly control it.\n\nUnderstand happiness.

Be honestly grateful   One thing you'll notice about unhappy people is they're always pointing to advantages that others received. Yet they rarely reflect on the advantages they've received. For example, the successful businessperson who constantly complains about the slackers, with little gratitude that they have the skills to be a top performer.   If you want to be happier, be grateful for what you've been given. That means acknowledging the fact that you may have been born with more advantages than most. In my own case, I was born to healthy college-educated parents, in a small city, who sent me to great public schools and expected me to get an education and do something with my life. On the scale of global humanity, I won the lotto. I could complain about my family's dysfunctions, and trust me, they're real. Or I can be grateful that I was born in a time and place where I can buy books, eat healthy food, and create an amazing life for myself.   Mike Robbins says, \" Gratitude and victimhood can't coexist.\"   2.  Own your ambition   Our society has an odd relationship with ambition. You're supposed to have some, but not too much. One way to increase your happiness is frank self-honesty about your personal goals. What level of achievement do you truly desire? Not what you think you should want, or how much money you'd like to have, but what is or is not burning inside of you?   But if you are hyper-ambitious give yourself permission to give voice to your desires. If you have that burning energy inside you, you know exactly what I'm talking about. When I decided I'm no longer going to apologize for my own fierce ambition, I quit framing my language around imaginings. I created concrete plans. It made me happier and brought me closer to my goals.   The secret to happiness is to be simultaneously grateful for where you are, while also striving for where you want to be.   3.  Stay  present   Unhappy people are always wishing for something else. They play the \"if only\" game: If only I had a better house or a different boss. If only I were married or single, then I would be happy.   Years of the \"if only\" game amounts to wishing your life away. Happiness is found in the present moment.   It's your one and only life; you're not going to get another one.   Show up for it every day with gratitude. Be honest about who you are, and stay present for the moment you're in. Your life won't be perfect, but it's totally within your power to make it 20% happier. :)\n\nThree ways to increase your happiness.    1 .

You know, you can't be like anyone. And no-one can either be like you ever. You have your own type of personality. Your individuality is your beauty. Accept it. Accept your uniqueness.   Sixthly, Smile often. Smiling is good for health as it reduces stress, betters your mood, helps you in avoiding regrets, makes you look attractive, beautiful and trustworthy. It will help you in building better relationships, ultimately, a happier version of you.   Most importantly, Stop asking others about the ways to be happy. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do it. Look for a hobby and try it often. It will make you happy.   I hope it helps.   Abhi\n\nHow can you be happy?   Hmmmm\u2026.   First of all, try positivity. Change your way of seeing things. Start looking for positive things in all of your experiences. E.g. Start seeing problems as learning opportunities.   Secondly, Develop a habit of being grateful about everything you have. Embrace the blessings or whatever you have right now. Never look upon the people who have more than you. Look to those who have nothing as compared to you and be grateful for whatever you have.   Thirdly, Share your gratitude with others.

Let's see what happens to our \"happiness\" here. When the honey moon period is over, that girl no longer gives me all that happiness that she used to. Because the moment I am in \"possession\" of my want (in this case the girl), my mind gets enclosed. That girl I got ceases to give any \"kick\". But having experienced that \"kick\" of happiness, my mind wants more of it!   Then what? Now, I want a buy a beautiful house. Well, you can imagine how my mind works here, right? This cycle continues till my grave and I die \"unhappily\"!   Now, let's re-examine the above example. I see a beautiful girl in a shopping mall. I admire her beauty (Just like the way I admire at looking at a Michel Angelo paintings, or Ajana\/Ellora sculptures), getting reminded of Keats, \"A Thing of Beauty is Joy Forever\", without any intention of \"possessing\" it! It makes me feel happy whenever I look at Beauty, be in be living and\/or non-living things!   So, the moment we want to hold it and in the very process of holding it,the joy in found in that person\/thing is lost!

Do not spend counterproductive time lamenting what you don't.     First and foremost, learn to love yourself.  It's an old adage and completely clich\u00e9, but all cliches are built atop a foundation of truth.     Nothing in the external world can make you happy.  Money cannot by itself bring you happiness.  Nor can romance, or children, or your dream job, or your dream house in your dream city, or all the knowledge in the universe.     Nor can the acquisition of that rare 1938 first issue Superman comic book (though that might temporarily assuage my sadness :) ).     Happiness cannot be bought, swindled, coerced or forced.     Happiness comes from within.   Think about all the qualities you admire in other people and work to embody those characteristics.  Be the kind of person you'd want to be friends with.   Happiness is not a matter of having something you want.  In fact, it's the exact opposite \u2013 happiness is wanting what you have.   \u201cWanting\u201d implies that something is missing... that there is an essential puzzle piece missing from your life without which you cannot be whole, cannot be complete.  How can you achieve happiness when you constantly feel like a part of you is AWOL?      That's not to say you can't be both happy  and  want something.  Having dreams or something to strive for can be very rewarding in and of itself.     But, a key part of happiness is letting go of the notion that, \u201cIf only I had ________, I could happy.\u201d  This is the cruelest of all mad libs.     So don't worry if you don't know what you want.  And certainly don't worry about worrying about what you don't know if you want.  Wait, now I'm confused...     As you mentioned, down that road lies only a self perpetuating circle of madness.     Slow down and enjoy the simple things in life.   Yeah, I know, another clich\u00e9... but there is so much beauty and wonder in the world that I can't help but be in awe of it.  I try to appreciate all the little things in life that I used to take for granted.   For example \u2013    The restful quietude of having alone time with a good book.   Imagining the unimaginable vastness of space while looking up at the stars in the night sky.   Sitting down to eat a favorite meal.    Making faces at the kid in the buggy in front of me at the grocery store.   Acquiring that rare 1938 first edition Superman comic.    Don't beat yourself up over any mistakes you've made or opportunities you might have missed.   One of my favorite lines from the Broadway musical Rent : \u201cForget regret, or life is yours to miss.\u201d  I've made tons of mistakes in my life.  There are days that I so fervently wish I could go back and change them that the desire to do so all but consumes me.     But, I can't.  I can't undo what's already done.  Accepting that is one of the hardest things in the world for me to do.     What I  can do is this - I can strive to make a new, better decision each and every passing moment.  I may not be happy with the person I used to be, but I can let go of that and be content with the person I've become.   Were I to go back and change even one single thing from my past I might not be the person I am today... and  her , I'm happy with.    This always helps too...\n\nJust remember the number 42... the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  42 is always your answer.   Naw, Just kidding...

You can get happiness out of the smallest things in life too, like a beautiful sunrise, a good chat with friends, or even a delicious meal. But you will have to make a mindset to adopt it as a part of your lifestyle. Once you do that, you can truly change how you enjoy and live your life!\n\nTry out new things!

Living in reality won't let you be happy because the reality is full of misery and pain. Though happiness comes in life in different forms (varying from materialistic to abstract), it fades away just as the source of your happiness does. And there's no source of happiness that's ever lasting in this world except for your life (I called your life ever lasting because it is as long as you can exist, if you get what I mean). So the only way for you to achieve ever lasting happiness (illusion) is to love your life no matter what, doing which is next to impossible because you need to be incredibly ignorant for that.   You wanna know what to do, well, here's a way for you pal. Actually you have a choice in the matter like you always do. Either accept the reality and learn to live without happiness. You'll be happy (or more like distracted from reality) as long as you know what distracts you (whether it's a person or games, movies, anime or whatever else), your one foot will always be on the reality nonetheless. Or just live in denial (the best way there's to achieve lasting happiness). Fill yourself with ideals, optimism and normalcy. See the world for what it presents, rather than what it is. Get inspired by motivational speakers and great heroes of the past and present. Surround yourself with like minded optimistic people. Living in denial will make you happy for sure. But you can't do that unless you're ignorant enough. So if your are not ignorant enough, you have no choice but to face the world for what it is and face yourself for the miserable creature you're. I might be wrong about everything I just wrote, but then again at the same time, I can't be, because in a world where truth is a matter of perspectives, everyone is right.\n\nNote : Jump to the last paragraph to avoid all the philosophical crap I wrote.   \u201cBasically, life's all about exploring yourself and the world.

Living in reality won't let you be happy because the reality is full of misery and pain. Though hap Continue Reading\n\nNothing can make you happy if you term it that way. You cannot be happy if you eat certain food, or wear certain clothes or be at a certain place and with certain people.   Happiness has no limits. It is not entitled to a certain situation. You should never know what makes you happy. Keep exploring, keep searching. The search itself is the happiness!!   You will have it once and you will want it from the same thing, situation or people again and again. Everything changes, you will too and your way of looking at happiness will too!!   Know you are happy and you will be happy!\n\nPavan Raina Philosophical nature by researching on mind and its behavior  \u00b7  Author has  11K  answers and  4.9M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 3y\n\nIf you know the mystery shall be no more and that can evolve another new query.

If we try to seek would find out that there have been so many moments which we have thought, acted and yet not registered in past whereas what we remember are about concerns and not useful.   If we lose the wealth we earn (in form of knowledge or essence) and run for wealth and fame which is external and temporary we run after unhappiness in my view.   Wealth is very important but how much we need is not known who runs more for it.   What to do \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026make me happy?   Satisfaction in any case is most important but we could develop a nature which could be leading towards unsatisfied life which could be a condition of mind and has nothing to do with any external part.   Once we come to know we are near a secret where satisfaction has to extrapolate into contentment and this nature is higher status and \/ or modified satisfaction with time and not living in past.   Thus if we can be happy in changed condition and continue to keep changing it is possible only when we are able to connect with changing time and flow with it.   It is possible when we are able to keep busy ourselves mentally and physically and spiritually with time so upgrading our knowledge and following discipline has a huge role in it.   Maintaining a good physical health shall keep us healthy and keeping engaged our self in constructive activities shall keep our mind healthy.   Time changes so with flow and to maintain these two component healthy we need assistance of spirituality as our own reference.   Once we learn to focus in our goal we learn to enjoy self alone at times which can work as exclusive time for self which can be used for reading, writing and any other hobbies we desire.   Doing prayer or reading hymns or chanting mantras or mythological stories all direct into a new direction which mind is not habitual and enjoy which is also essential to give experience of contentment as feeling.   We could experience only when we have passed enough time in practicing method and using time efficiently which was being wasted before.   We are not only happy, satisfied and learning to feel contentment \u2026is endless limit and possibility but we have to add spark in life reduce wastage of energy and make our self efficient physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nIf you know the mystery shall be no more and that can evolve another new query.

If it is peace what you feel, and you can gratefully say that there is nothing more you could wish for, then I would want to claim that you are happy.   But given you have been searching the internet for what makes happiness, I would go with the option that you are trying to figure out what you are missing.   I can sometimes very much relate to not wanting anything, to not knowing where to go from now, what to do now, how to achieve happiness when I do not feel I am really lacking something.   I think that this is simply the feeling of numbness. Sometimes better than feeling real bad, sometimes even worse.   I think that what you described here above, is a lack of passion.   And numbness makes you feel like you dont need one, and you dont really, but this is how youre going to continue feeling unless you find some.   Sometimes I dont have a particular passion for something, a specific goal or hobby, sometimes   I just feel the pure  passion to live . To discover, to experience. The thrill for all the things that are yet to come. And that is my favourite passion to be honest. To feel thrilled for the unknown just for no reason, just for being so filled of love for life.   You dont need to want to achieve something, to want to buy something. You dont need to want to become a successful bussinessman in order to feel like you have a proper goal, like you are on your way to happiness.  What you need to know, in my opinion, is what makes you happy.  That can also take time, it is not obvious for everyone straight away when they think about it. I think that it is a process of discovering. Maybe you dont need to add anything new into your life, you dont need to find a new hobby or a new country to travel to.  Maybe you just need to look at what you have, to think about things you already know, and realise, which of these things make your heart beat. Which make you feel alive. The thought of which makes you want to stand up and start doing something.   So, how can you be happy when you dont want anything? I think that these two parts of this sentence are related in a different way than the way you think. When you want something, you are basically feeling the absence of something you like. I understand that somebody may \u201cwant\u201d a good job, and then they find a good job and then they are happy. And you dont want a good job, because you already have it or youre simply not interested in it now, so where to get the \u201chappy\u201d part now? Well, if you dont want it deliberately because, lets say, you enjoy staying at home for the moment, then it should make you happy to be able to sleep long, to cook your lunch, to watch your favourite series or whatever. But if you dont want a good job, because you simply dont know which job would be good for you, because you dont know what you want, then thats what you should start working on.  How? By observing what makes you feel good and what doesnt, and eventually even writting it down. If you are not getting enough impulses from your daily life, then you should maybe try something new, and evaluate it later. Find out what you liked and what you didnt, and your desires might get more specific and you might realise that there is something what makes you feel full of live and that you want to get it, or keep doing that.   I think that you need to find what forces you to give love. What makes you feel the \u201cclick\u201d. And thats a process. Be patient and try to follow the little signs, the little things that make you feel good, because they usually lead to bigger things that make you feel even better. And you might not need to accomplish something huge then.   You might just need to find the treasure hidden in your own room.  It doesnt have to be difficult, you just need to know what it is.  I believe that everyone can get passionate about something. Just it is a different thing for each of us, so it is our task to follow our own hearts.   Not everyone is born knowing that he loves to play piano and has a talent for playing piano and starts to play piano.  Most of us just need to figure out what makes us feel alive along the way. And that is completely alright.   It is a rather pleasant task, I would say.\n\nI think that if you were happy, you would know it.  And you would not feel fear, but peace.

They go through life without any real direction, without any real sense of what will make them happy. They just sort of flounder around, hoping that something will eventually make them happy.   But the truth is, if you don't know what will make you happy, you're never going to be truly happy. You might have moments of happiness, but they'll be fleeting and they'll never last.

They go through life without any real direction, without any real sense of what will make them happy. They just sort of flounder around, hoping that something will eventually make them happy.   But the truth is, if you don't know what will make you happy, you're never going to be truly happy. You might have moments of happiness, but they'll be fleeting and they'll never last.   So how can you find out what will make you happy? The answer is actually quite simple: you have to experiment. You have to try new things, take risks, and see what brings you joy.   It might take some time, but eventually you'll find the things that make you happy. And once you find them, you'll be able to create a happy and fulfilling life for yourself.   Some general pieces of advice that can help you find what will make you happy.   1. Follow your heart.   This might sound clich\u00e9d, but it\u2019s true. You need to do what you feel is right for you, not what others think is right for you. Only you know what will make you happy, so trust your instincts.   2. Do what you love.   If you find a job or hobby that you\u2019re passionate about, chances are you\u2019ll be happy doing it. It\u2019s important to find something that you enjoy and makes you feel good, as this will make it easier to stick with.   3. Be with people who make you happy.   Spending time with people who make you feel good is crucial to happiness. Whether it\u2019s family, friends, or a romantic partner, being around positive people will help you feel better about yourself and life in general.   4. Take care of yourself.   It\u2019s important to take care of your physical and mental health if you want to be happy. Eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep are all key to feeling your best. Additionally, it\u2019s important to do things that make you feel good mentally, such as spending time outdoors, reading, or doing something creative.   5. Be grateful.   One of the best ways to feel happier is to focus on the things you\u2019re grateful for. No matter how big or small, there are always things in your life to be thankful for. Expressing gratitude can help you see the positive aspects of your life and feel more content.   6. Simplify your life.   Sometimes, less is more. If your life feels overly complicated or stressful, it might be time to simplify. This could involve decluttering your home, getting rid of unnecessary possessions, or streamlining your work life. Clearing out the unnecessary can help you feel calmer and happier.   7. Set goals.   Working towards goals can give you a sense of purpose and make you feel good about yourself. Whether it\u2019s personal, professional, or financial goals, having something to strive for can keep you motivated and on track.   8. Be present.   One of the keys to happiness is learning to be present. This means living in the moment and enjoying the simple things in life. It can be easy to get caught up in what\u2019s happening in the future or dwelling on the past, but neither of these things can be changed. Focusing on the present can help you appreciate what you have and find contentment.   9. Do something for others.   One of the best ways to feel good is to do something for someone else. Whether it\u2019s volunteering, donating to charity, or simply helping a friend, giving back can make you feel happy and fulfilled.   10. Accept yourself.   Last but not least, it\u2019s important to accept yourself for who you are. This includes your flaws and imperfections. Learning to love yourself is an important step in finding happiness.\n\nIt's a simple question, but it's one that plagues many people.

You may not achieve them, have to change them, or have adapt them to new realities (but hey, that\u2019s life!), and that\u2019s just fine, because the satisfaction is not in the achievement, but in the journey itself! Always be on the move, people that vegetate and do nothing, are inviting negativity, self doubt and loss of purpose into their lives, while people on the move, are too busy doing, growing, enjoying life, and moving forward, to lose time on those things. Participate actively in family, friends and similarly minded (sports, arts, social, etc.) group activities!

Thank God! i was not into any relationships at that phase...At last, quite successfully I had surpassed all those hurdles..ups and downs....achieved  so many things..travelled a lot..made a good numbers,..even in quora too... etc..and now,I started answering you(still if you need any suggestions you can PM me,no matter what the topic may be.. and i can tell my story,but i don't wanna stress on that much).   Let me tell you something \u2013 I get it, and believe me, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to be frustrated and have broken dreams. It\u2019s okay if things didn\u2019t quite turn out as you wanted them to. It\u2019s okay if you hate yourself a little too. No, I am in no way trying to be a spiritual healer here.....   Let me ask you something first. Remember the time when you were 13 or 14 or 15 and decided to become something...like someone...may be like your role model, because you had both the talent and the passion? So think....where exactly are you now? cooped up and blaring your drums?   But remember, it is you, only you, who possesses the power to either alter your destiny or succumb into the black abyss you\u2019re apparently facing. And trust me on this, you just need to let go.Let go of those shards of broken dreams you\u2019re still carrying. Let go of those things you yearned for and hoped to achieve some day. Because it\u2019s okay to do so. Life is a constant flow yes, but it doesn\u2019t follow a set path, and definitely not the one you set for it.   Start knowing your positives....try to open the closed doors... get some wisdom and knowledge,not on all the topics at a time..first get well acquainted with your subjects,then slowly shift... Damn sure!!! you can make it... accept people...try to mingle with them.... every moment...keep a smile on your face...it changes a lot. enter into some clubs like literary..etc or start a new one...be curious...take responsibilities..work hard..be smart.   I believe..even i want you too believe, \u201cThere are just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn.\u201d Still, i have a lot to say, but i will end it here.   Enjoy your fully! All the best. :) :)\n\nwell!!

Fiction, biographies, self-help etc. Make this a habit, read whenever you find time. Listen to audiobooks while commuting. It also develops your english speaking skills at a vast range. Exercise : Best way to improve your confidence. Hit the gym, choose your preferred option. Improve your strength, stamina, and muscle. Go for weight training, crossfit or calisthenics. Your body gets into a proper shape, this builds up your confidence. Confidence is the key to get social. Hobby : Develop a hobby, learn about it and get better in it. Try your hands on different things and choose the one you\u2019re most comfortable with. Swimming, hiking, playing music, writing, running, etc. This can eventually turn to be your stress-buster. Spend your free time wisely : Don\u2019t scroll through social media or watch youtube for countless hours. Do something which makes sense, watch youtube videos by which you can gain knowledge, ted talks, learn microsoft office on youtube or any other stuff which grabs your attention. Goal : What do you want in life? Find an answer for this and write it down. What should you do to achieve it? Think about it, you know all the answers. Write it down somewhere or note it in your phone, read it before hitting the sack and after waking up. Read it daily and measure your progress. Create short-term goals, long-term goals and make your own path to achieve it. Don\u2019t be afraid of failure, that is when you learn. Learn from your every mistake. Do your best every damn time. Step out of your comfort zone:  Do what scares you, learn to do it better. Keep doing it, until you master it. Leave your hometown and live in a different city. You will be amazed by learning your potential. Earn your own bread and savour your hard work. If you think you can\u2019t do something, accept it and learn later how to do it. Get better at it everytime. Never have second options : Don\u2019t have an second option in your mind. Just one goal and no alternatives. You will feel safe when you have a second option and this increases your chances of not giving 100%. Never ever have alternatives and this gives you the potential to give 110% everytime. Do your best:  Always do your best, every time make sure you put best effort. Don\u2019t think about the result while doing the work.

No one probably understands them as you can. Most Important of all-  Take it easy on yourself . Don't curse yourself everyday for the way you are. Things are not going to change overnight. Its a long process. Just try to keep your spirits high.  Even 1 good friend is enough. You don't need 10 friends to make your life fun. Also, its perfectly ok to not have GF.

And then when you have enough confidence, pursue it as your full time profession. Even if you improve small things on daily basis, you will find yourself much ahead in your life when you look back after 1 year from now.\n\nYou don't have to love what you already have.

If I just sit around thinking that happiness and satisfaction are the same thing, I will never be able to improve my life.   I am happy because I have wonderful people in my life. I'm not satisfied because living life on a wheelchair is not how I imagined it. Happiness and satisfaction are determined by us, but it is possible to be happy but not satisfied and vice versa.   I believe that if I stay unhappy, satisfaction will be hard to come by. I believe that living life to the fullest and making small changes in my life to get satisfaction is what will help me reach my goal.   I really hope that makes sense.\n\nLeonard has given a wonderful and short, overall answer. I want to give you an answer on experiences from my life and in greater detail.

Being satisfied with oneself is not easy, this situation of self doubt eats up the confidence and makes the person question his own personality.   As far as my experience is concerned, I have dealt with the situation of identity crisis so I know how frustration it is to dwell in the feelings of negativity towards oneself. Begin by creating realistic goals in life. Unhappiness is caused by the gap that exist between the idealized self and the real self. Thus the first approach is to make realistic goals in life. Assess your emotions, thoughts and abilities and then define your goals according to it. Set short term goals in everything you do. Instead of setting an unrealistic long term goal. Make short term goals towards the changes that you want to see them in your personal life. Observe your transition and be proud of your own self. Once you are able to work upon your personal goals, you can assess the root cause of your insecurities. Don't strive to be your perfect self, strive to be better than yesterday. That should be the spirit lighting up in your heart.\n\nSelf acceptance is the key !

A student  \u2013 His duty is to study, he passes or fails that\u2019s not in his control. The student does not study just for the sake of passing his exams. When he studies, he learns. Whether he pases or fails he should not be too happy or too sad about it. If ever a student studies for the sole purpose of passing his exams, in the end he has not learned anything even if he has passed.  But if he studies because he considers learning and studying as his duty, he won\u2019t even need to be worried whether he will pass or fail.  And such a student as we have always seen they are most likely to pass their exams. Unless they are not able to reach their exam for some reason. But still he should not be sad about it. Why? Because the most important is at least he performed his duty well.   Selflessness: When we help someone, we don\u2019t do it for the sake of something in return, whether we are rewarded for our actions or not, this is not our concern. And when we help someone without worrying about our own gains, this is selflessness. We don\u2019t think what are we going to get from that. The importance is that as a human being we have been able to help someone.   From the above two (real life and very much possible cases) we realize or rather recall that whenever we worried too much about the result, we have screwed up the process.  Geeta says : we must concentrate on our duties with a selfless mind. The more we are selfless, the more we will be happy and serving. The more we are happy, the more we will he able to serve better.   Lets take some real life examples Mahatma Gandhi   Why Mahatma? why not Abraham Lincoln?   You may ask me this question, to which my reply will be : Abraham Lincoln had a modest background, he was very humble and hardworking and even though he had too many failures, he succeeded.  But , Mahatma Gandhi, aka Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was from a well-to-do family, from one of the most prosperous states of India. In those days education was not easy to come by for Indians, but, he did his law from University college, London. What changed his mind? why did he leave the high profile career to come back and help people of India?  The answer is evident -  he realized his duties to the mankind, to the people of India and their liberation.   I am a hedonist, I am often fascinated by gadgets, cars etc, very much. Most of are.  But think of a situation when you will be very happy - for me it is \"doing something for the poor and homeless children, not surrounded iPads and iPhones\".    Its when you have realized what is your sole purpose in life - to serve the mankind; believe me, you will be happy yet crave for betterment.   If material gains make one happy, then we will never be satisfied. Sooner or later we all will realize this.    We came empty handed in this world and cannot take anything except love, so our goal must be to achieve that love, rest all will fall in place.   Thanks for A2A Godly! I am sorry, I didn't realize that A2A price is progressive. I don't deserve a 4400 tag. I will correct this.\n\nThis is something I am not, but I want to become.

Comparing with anyone in whatever concept will always let you down and demotivate you . You can never be proud of yourself while comparing with some one else . Everyone has a unique self . You must be good in something that is discovered by you or yet to be discovered . Maybe in terms of studies or extra curriculum or you may be a motivation to others. See people will not never allow you to live happily when you are on right path or succeeding .

We have difficulty living happily because we have become very good at making ourselves miserable and unhappy. One way is negatively labeling what happens as problems and lamenting about there being many problems in life. Or how many have a fundamental belief (learned at an early age) of not being good enough or something is wrong with us\u2026and so this comes back again and again\u2026never letting us be happy for long. If you want to live happily, realize all your misery and unhappiness is not because of what is happening in your life but because of your own beliefs, misconceptions, and ignorance (like \u201cI am not good enough\u201d or \u201csomething is wrong with me\u201d or etc.).\n\nFirst give up this idea of there being many problems in life.

I'll try to explain the things that worked for me(might not work for you). So let's see. Try to find happiness in simple things of life. Whenever you feel stressed, talk to a friend, maybe try and do something that you actually enjoy. Maybe you won't feel like doing it initially, but slowly try and get into it, it'll get better. Change the way you think. Rather than thinking how horrible and mean life is to you, think about the privileges that you have got, which is still a luxury to so many people.

Rather than thinking how horrible and mean life is to you, think about the privileges that you have got, which is still a luxury to so many people. It can be something as simple as, having a roof over your head, or getting to eat food everyday. Or being healthy. So many kids suffer from cancer and other life threatening diseases and many of them don't even get to have 2 proper meals a day. Being grateful really helps. Life is all about hurdles, after crossing which you get to learn so many things. Happiness being one of them. Also, remember, God made you with a purpose. Even Shri Krishna himself, while living a mortal life didn't have a worry-less and easy life. Be strong, have faith in yourself, and DON'T EVER GIVE UP. YOU GOT THIS. Don't ever doubt yourself or your capabilities. Everybody is made different hence never compare yourself to anyone. Happiness lies within yourself. Hence, you can only get out of a dark phase only if YOU WANT TO. Its all about your willingness to get out of that darkness and pull yourself up to be able to see the light. Never hesitate to ask for help, but at the same time never depend COMPLETELY on someone for emotional and moral support. You can do this! Have faith in yourself and keep smiling \u2764\ufe0f   Signing off ~ Adrija\n\nThe answer is very simple. I'll try to explain the things that worked for me(might not work for you). So let's see.

My wife and child nearly died in childbirth only 3 months ago. My mum suffers with major disabilities that prevent her from leaving the house. With a short clip of my backstory in mind, I am currently going through therapy to deal with PTSD, anger and anxiety. I will make a small list of the things I help keeps the positives going in life: I try to help others. Hence I\u2019m sat here typing this :). Whilst I may be doing this for selfish reasons, it certainly helps validate my life and makes me feel that I am worth something, if not just a mindless drone at work. I note the world around me. If there\u2019s a pretty sunset I will take a moment to appreciate it, the same if my child smiles at me. I celebrate accomplishments of the day. Even if it\u2019s just being able to make a proper meal at home. I avoid the News. Too much of my anxiety is caused by the state of the world we live in, and I find it better living in ignorant bliss than stressing myself with the problems outside of my direct existence. I focus task by task. If I have a day off I try to keep busy. I avoid too much time on my own. Time for yourself is great when you have hobbies to keep you occupied, however alone thinking time can increase paranoia and stress. I stay away from social media. Too many reasons to explain why, mostly similar to why I keep away form the news. Social media breeds envy and causes a lot of jealousy\/annoyance. Especially if you do not agree with peoples opinions. If I feel anxiety creeping in, I tell myself everything is okay. I listen to calming music\/ocean waves\/ASMR to destress. The main goal here is not necessarily to feel \u2018happy\u2019 but to feel content. Happiness is just another chemical reaction in the brain that we end up chasing when we feel the opposite. At least with feeling content we can manage our emotions a little clearer. Try to see happiness as a extreme amount of serotonin in the brain, if we have too much of it we end up with a come down. Just like if you go to a music festival and get the \u2018festival blues\u2019 afterwards. It was fun whilst it lasted, but we always feel bad afterward.   Try to make changes to your life that help you feel content. Become more minimalist and appreciate the small things. Try to be nice to others as much as possible and just smile at everyone you meet. Eventually, your life with bring you happiness on it\u2019s own.\n\nFor a bit of back story, I\u2019m going to bullet point some things from my life: My father was in hospital for most of my childhood in intensive care.

Then my mother was saying, \"Agar koi achii means descent job lage to kahi bheje bhi.\" And we were trying to tell her that, \"Mom for this we need to go far from the house.\" Then the cousin brother was telling me some examples that there are lots of girls who studied at home but did get great success, it is okay if you can't go to Delhi because if someone wants something badly, they will do it in any circumstances. After all these conversations, I felt very bad that why I can't do anything according to me, what we wore, where we going, and all the things were confirmed by them, with whom I marry or when I married all the things are planned by them without an opinion. Or if I want to pursue my dream, then they will only decide that I can pursue it or not or if I wanted to be financially independent then only they will decide. I was crying alone if you can't let me do any job why did you guys force me to study really hard and only focus on this. While I was thinking about all this, I realized one thing that Mumma didn't directly tell me that I can't do a job she just wants a decent job (according to them in which any girl can maintain her home chores as well). And what if I got my dream come true and do you think even after they won't let you do that career. And she even told us they she is always there for the support and the actual reason of her this behavior is because she never went to school and didn't see any girl who can do both work and maintain the family happy. And the reason she can't let me go out is not just that she don't want me to go out as a girl but because she is very possessive for all of her children and she never stopped me in Jaipur whatever I want to do and wherever I want to go. She indeed supports me, and only my dream can change her behavior, so I have to work very hard and let people change their view. Q - How can you be happy even though there are many problems in life that you are facing? What should be the good things to do to live happily? See in starting I was quite upset that why she can't let me go far and pursuing for a job but later while giving second thought I realized that things are not exactly how they look. She never opposed for doing a job but her mindset is like if someone is doing a job than who will manage the home chores and there is just the problem with the mindset, and I can change her and many people like her's mindset by doing my dream career and maintaining all the other things just need support behind us. So there are no problems actually, there is always a solution for every problem we just need to change our attitude towards that and trust me sometimes problems are nothing if we compare it to others but the thing is we are giving it too much thought. And mera ro ek siddhant hai ki har cheej ko ek baar positive najariye se dekhke try karo pakka usme bhi kuch an kuch accha hoga hi.

I replied that my mother can't let me go so far; she is very possessive. Then my mother came and sat with us, and I sarcastically asked her, \"Bhaiya bol rahe hai ki masters ke liye DU ka form bhar de.\" And Mumma replied, \"Ki me tujhe itni door kese bheju.\" \"Vese bhi tujhe konsi naukari karni hai,\" she added, \"To tu to yahi rehke padh le, vese bhi teri bhabhi hi job nhi kar rahi to tu kese Continue Reading\n\nRakesh Prasad Practicing & Teaching Self-Development for Allround Success  \u00b7  Author has  198  answers and  148.1K  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 2y\n\nProblems are situations that cause us discomfort and sometimes emotional pain.

So all you need to do is find your true, real self. Who you really are is no other than happiness itself.   Your true, real self, is who is looking (subject), not what is seen (objects), such as body, mind, thoughts, feelings, speech and behaviour. Who or what body, mind, thoughts and feelings appear to, is the true, real self. Cultivate awareness of who or what everything appears to. To do this is to cultivate awareness of awareness. In this there are no limitations and boundaries that could produce unhappiness.   Therefore, all you need to do to feel happy all the time, is to turn awareness around to its apparent source: you (subject), cultivating awareness of you.   Cultivating this kind of awareness, you will discover how it is possible to feel depressed or worried, and yet be happy. This is a strange paradox, to be sure.   How can I feel genuine happiness while experiencing fear or worry?   This happens when there is no interference or attempt to control what you are feeling. When there is no movement of thought in relation to a feeling of unhappiness, no effort at all to get rid of this feeling, the feeling is experienced as a passing phenomenon that in no way affects I. This feeling then doesn't define who I am, or provide any indication of who I am. I am therefore unaffected by this passing show.   This kind of experience, in which I experience a low feeling, but am totally unaffected by it, is known as disidentifcation. This negative feeling provides me with another opportunity to observe everything from the outside: it is as if I am standing outside myself, observing myself. It is just like looking at somebody else's problem: it has no bearing on me, so I am personally unaffected.   Unhappiness is part of the false self. This false self is your self-image. The self-image is a composite mental construct, consisting of body, mind, thoughts and feelings. These things have no separate existence. What creates the illusion that they exist the way we normally experience them, as separate phenomena with boundaries, is thought.   This is great news, for by pulling out the false self by its roots, unhappiness disappears forever.   This doesn't mean you lose the ability to experience fear, worry, anxiety, or any other feeling of unhappiness. The difference is that you are no longer affected by these feelings. They no longer define who you are. Do you know what a big difference that makes?   In the classic Buddhist literature it is often said that suffering doesn't disappear. What disappears is the one who suffers. An enlightened one experiences the identical feelings to an unenlightened one: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings and sensations. The difference is that the enlightened one is unaffected by unpleasant and neutral feelings and sensations. This difference is often described in the following terms:   \u201c Suffering is there, but no one who suffers \u201d.   Finding your real self therefore means discovering there is no self as a separate being with boundaries. The experience of being a separate person is the root cause of every kind of suffering, including all feelings of unhappiness.   As long as you feel yourself to be a separate being of form, you are basically limiting yourself. The experience of limitation is itself suffering, creating the separate self who then suffers. Being a limited self or person, you are just triggering the body's  fight-flight-freeze-fawn  survival responses over and over, in order to perpetuate yourself as a limited being of form. Obviously, if you don\u2019t, you die. Who you think you are, dies.   To drop who you know you are - the self-image: thinking, experiencing, believing you are body and mind, thoughts and feelings - is to transcend the experience of someone being here who suffers. This may not sound like much, but it is literally the difference between Heaven and Hell. To experience what suffering is, without there being someone here to experience all this suffering, is inimitable happiness, equanimity, and peace.   To discover this incomparable happiness, superior to every other kind of happiness you can experience, all you need to do is let go of who you think you are. When that self vanishes, so does the suffering that was part of that self.   To do this, to get anywhere near this, just keep shifting attention from what you experience (objects), to you (subject), without defining yourself.  If you define or try to figure out who you are, you are merely resurrecting another version of the self who suffers: \u201cSuffering is there, and someone who suffers.\u201d   When you observe yourself as the observing subject (observe the watcher), you see your own mental reactions. You see that when you react mentally, you suffer. When you don't react mentally, you don't suffer. To see this is to see that suffering isn't in reality - nobody and nothing out there causes your suffering: suffering is only in you. This is the realisation that reality is perfect. When reality is seen to be perfect, there is nothing to be unhappy about. To discover this for yourself, is to realise how to feel happy all the time.   Happiness isn't a choice. Choice demonstrates confusion. Either you are aware of yourself as subject, without choice, or you aren't aware of yourself as subject, in which case you start controlling, manipulating and adjusting yourself in an effort to get rid of your discomfort. In awareness there is no effort whatsoever to get rid of anything, including a feeling of unhappiness. You arrive at this choiceless awareness, simply by bringing attention back to you (subject), observing what you are doing now, if anything. When you observe yourself doing nothing at all, unconditional, causeless happiness is. In this there may be a feeling of suffering, but no one - no separate being with its boundaries - who suffers. Thus the underlying feeling of happiness persists, no matter what happens.\n\nThis is very simple once you understand that happiness isn't separate from who you are. So all you need to do is find your true, real self. Who you really are is no other than happiness itself.   Your true, real self, is who is looking (subject), not what is seen (objects), such as body, mind, thoughts, feelings, speech and behaviour. Who or what body, mind, thoughts and feelings appear to, is the true, real self. Cultivate awareness of who or what everything appears to. To do this is to cultivate awareness of awareness.

However, you have never given them adequate attention since they don\u2019t give you any monetary returns.  You are busy doing things that are useful rather than joyful.  Do something every day that give your joy and you can see the difference.   3: Get Rid of Doing What You Dislike   Pain is always more powerful than pleasure. When you are doing anything against your wishes, you suffer in the process.  Try to enjoy the things that you do. If you can\u2019t enjoy your work, change your work and do something which you love.  Choosing the right profession is a very important for happiness.   4: Be Ready for Suffering   Just like every person falls sick once in a while, you too have to suffer pain once in a while. Be ready for failures, sufferings and rejections.  When you are ready for sufferings, they cease to have any effect on you.  Remember the wise words of William Shakespeare, \u201c There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so \u201d.   Don\u2019t chase happiness.   Focus on doing the right things in your life and happiness shall never leave you.\n\nHappiness and positivity are deeply connected with each other.

Don\u2019t cling onto a desire, because whenever a desire is fulfilled, it leaves you in the same place that you were before the desire arose. And not all desires can be fulfilled. Some get fulfilled, some don\u2019t.   The secret to happiness is in  being without desires , and in focusing on how you can serve others. The more you serve, the more happiness you will get.  Having this feeling, 'I don't want anything for myself, I am contented', brings happiness .   When you give and contribute to people who need you more than you need anything else, that also gives you the strength to move through those moments when you cannot smile.   If you turn your mind inward a little bit, and just observe what is happening inside you, you will always be happy. Unhappiness means you have gone away from  Your Self . You have gotten caught up in the world outside of you. So take a step back,  turn inward and look within, and then you find that 'you are happiness '.   It\u2019s the Self consciousness that always gives you happiness, like the Sun always gives you light. Can the Sun ever give you darkness, no! Similarly the  Self  always radiates happiness and energy. But when you move away from that, then your energy goes down and sadness wells up.   Sorry !..

Admire, never follow   \u2022Your hero or Social influencers are just selling products they are not real even.   \u2022When you say you admire something about somebody, you point exactly towards what appeals to your mind. Your focus stays on the source of your admiration, which could be their actions, beliefs, creativity, or their intelligence. 4. Screw pleasing people.   \u2022So it starts with self worth.let's talk about self-worth. What does it mean? It means that you are valuable. How do we get this? It is self-worth after all; the first thing it requires is a \u2018self\u2019. When you have a self to serve, the self tells you what the worth is. When you don\u2019t, you have to depend on others. When they give you confirmation of having worth, you feel happiness. Let me repeat that once again: you depend on others to tell you what your worth is, and this arrangement makes you happy. Out-fucking-standing, mate.   5. Don't stuck-up with relationship.   \u2022There are many reasons why people get trapped in shitty relationships. Let\u2019s talk about them: You think that you will never find a person as good looking as them; you will never find a person as great at sex as they are. You will never be able to love somebody again; nobody understands you better than them. \u2022If you are stuck in a shitty relationship and these are your reasons, then you need to hear some truths. First, these are highly over-exaggerated assumptions; two, stop trying to predict the future. Unless you are seventy years old and have had all sorts of experiences, you need to shut the fuck up. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THING   Choose satisfaction, not happiness   Mind you, self-satisfaction does contain precise knowledge of what would make the \u2018self\u2019 happy, but it\u2019s only one part of the whole picture. Self-satisfaction starts with the knowledge of the self. The thing with knowledge of such kind is, when it\u2019s not applied, it gets locked up in the theoretical side of your brain to be used later when you wish to sound smart or give smart advice. Knowledge of self, therefore, can only be achieved by knowing with certainty that it works when applied in reality   Thank you!!!\n\n1.Live in present.   \u2022Let me clear you guys, live in present is perfect answer.

Unless you're a sociopath, nothing else has as great a potential to contribute to your happiness as positive interactions with other people. Find something you really enjoy doing. Even if you can't make a career out of it, make it a priority in your life. Go rock climbing. Tinker around with your car. Build a ship in a bottle. Design a website. Human beings have an innate need to be challenged and to improve themselves. You will derive great satisfaction from your achievements and personal growth. Avoid feeling threatened by people who are better than you. Even if you can never be as good as them at something, so what? Don't chase material possessions or tons of meaningless sex in an effort to compensate for not truly being happy. It appears that it does little to improve overall satisfaction in life. (But that doesn't mean material possessions and meaningless sex are bad  per se .) Don't judge other people. It won't do them any good, and it'll make you unhappy, too. Live and let live. Resist the pressure to conform to what society is telling you you should want, and to do what society tells you you should do. Don't get married to the wrong person just because society is telling you that you should get married. Don't have kids just because society is telling you that you should have kids. These are two of the biggest mistakes that most people could possibly make. If you find that you're unhappy even though many other people in similar life situations are content, consider the possibility that you may be depressed. If you really are depressed, then none of these tips are really going to help you unless you get therapy. The funny thing is that most of the items on this list are things that people gradually discover as they get older. That's why people tend to become happier as they get older.\n\nI feel unqualified to answer this, but I've listened to what other people say and selected what I consider to be the best parts: Find people who are kind and genuinely care about you, whose company you enjoy.

I was the world's most unhappy person. But I did not lose trust on me. Yet my life doesn't change dramatically overnight. Still, I am struggling with my problems. But I have changed my attitude after several failures in life. Literally the realization came inside me after completing 40 hours meditation course.   Happiness is a state of mind where we are satisfied about ourselves, family, career and enjoying every moment of our life on day-to-day basis. I have decided that whatever situation comes, I will be happy. Now I feel surprised to see kids smile, laugh a lot to watch Mr Bean's movies, spend time in nature, do 10 push-up everyday and enjoy every single moment of life. Life is simple but amazing. There are few things which I follow to become happy everyday- Life is more than that of getting chance in world class universities, high paid corporate job, buying new gadgets and chasing opposite\/same sex :  We all are running behind high paying job, buying new gadgets, chasing opposite\/same sex and trying to get chance in top class universities. Literally these things have importance at some extent. But it is not everything. Life is all about helping people, serving humanity, chasing passion and make positive change in society and I try to follow these things at everyday. Silver lining effect :  Silver lining is a sign of hope in an unfortunate or gloomy situation. Every cloud has a silver lining. It is the some basis for hope or some comforting aspect in the midst of suffering, frustration, misfortune etc. I am optimistic person despite hundreds of failures. I run every morning, do positive self-talk and motivate people. Basically I do it to inspire myself and avoid negativity of my life. Use smart phone wisely :  I use smart phone wisely. I don't check   my smartphone within 5\u201310 minutes. When people are gossiping with each other, most of the time they are busy with their smartphone. People give more importance to virtual people instead of real life people. I avoid smartphone when I talk with other people. Smartphone is making us unsocial. They play games, check notifications, do browsing and texting continuously. It's an addiction. I only use productivity apps, read PDF version of self-help book, send official mail, restore some nice songs and meditation audio clips in my smartphone. Overall, I use smartphone for short period of time per day. Making distance with social website activities :  I have limited my social website activities.   I deactivated my facebook account. Stop using whatsapp, Instragram, twitter and wechat. Moreover, I spend only few minutes in quora. Now I have more time to focus on real life rather than virtual life. Stop doing pointless internet browsing:  We waste time by opening several tabs in browser and waste enormous times in online. We browse randomly. It's like changing tv channel continuously.   We don't know what's our destination. It creates unrest situation in our mind. I strictly avoid pointless browsing. No more selfie :  I feel good to see people when they spend leisure time in several beautiful places. But interestingly they are too busy taking selfies for posting on social site, instead of enjoying nature and time when they are on vacation. When I travel anywhere, I keep my phone switch off or silent. No selfie, I just enjoy the nature. Disappear for few days  : Stress, competition, expectation is involved with our life.   I take leave from my job and disappear for few days. Explore my country, enjoy the sunset in beach, trekking the mountain, taste the variety of foods in different parts of my country. Let go past failures  : I let go my past failures. I forget my past failures and learn from those mistakes. Past has already gone, if we think about it again and again, nothing will be changed. It's better to learn from those mistakes and work hard for making better future. Gratitude what you have:  Millions of people in the whole world don't have shelter to live, food to eat and   have nobody to love them. I have a gratitude list and everyday I write 10 things that why I am gratitude to life. Never expect anything  :Expectation hurts. So,I have no expectation from me. I think that I have no right to get anything. Whatever I get, that is bonus from me. Literally, I have zero expectation. It helps me to lead a tension free life. Try to be early riser  : I wake up 5 a.m. at everyday. Then I start planning the whole day. I have plenty of times to do productive works. Wake up early in the morning helps to start the day with fresh hope. Use  30 Day Fit Challenge Workout - Android Apps  :  This app is mainly designed for people who are too busy to go to a gym.   One of the best apps which is very conducive to maintain physical work out.   I can track my fitness progress and able to make a positive change in my life by using this app. I use this app everyday to improve my physical fitness. Meditate 1 hour at every day  : Meditation has changed my life completely. I have found the inner peace which is very important for our life.   I usually meditate 1 hour at every day. Help underprivileged people :  Helping underprivileged people   gives me mental satisfaction. That's a great feeling. Nothing can be compared with this feeling. I try to help poor children by financially. Now they go to school regularly and draw colorful pictures. Their smiling faces make my life amazing. Being a positive self-image  : If someone says to me, shovan, you are great. I feel good.   If someone says to me, shovan, you are ass-whole. I feel terrible. It indicates that My mood depends up to you and I have no control on my mood. But it should not happen. You must have a constant idea about yourself. I try to persist a positive self image about myself whatever people tell about me. Being a positive self image is prerequisite for happiness. Talk with CEO to taxi-driver :  It's like symbolic. But I have started to talk with rich to poor people. I try to socialize all types of people. Everyone has a unique story to tell. There are lots of learning from every story. I love to listen. It gives me immense pleasure. Follow 10 minutes Smile rule :  I smile a lot. It helps me to make my life easy. I smile without reason. Every day I try to practice   smile a loud at least 10 minutes. It sounds weird, but it is really effective to be happy at everyday. Develop sense of humor and watch comedy movies:  I am trying to develop sense of humor, make jokes, share and fun with my friends. Besides, I watch the movies of Charlie Chaplin, Jim Carrey and Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean). Watching comedy movie gives me pleasure. Always pronounce \u201cI am happy\u201d :  I always pronounce \u201cI am happy\u201d Whenever I get time, I pronounce it. It has a positive impact at everyday. Pronounce it thousands times at everyday. It really works. By repeating this sentence more and more, our subconscious mind start to believe that, yes, I am happy. Find happiness from my own world:  Everybody has a separate world where he\/she loves to do some works. It can be hobby or passion. You can find happiness from your own world by doing your favorite works such as studying, singing, writing, reading, playing instruments, programming and so on. I find happiness to write everyday. Find positive side among every negativity:  I try to find positivism among every negativity. I have been rejected by employers, fired by employers, ignored by girls and so on. Every failure makes me new realization and learning. I have found positive side among those failures and working to develop my skill to overcome the problems. Read, listen and Watch good stuffs :  I read self-help books, fiction and non-fiction novels, listen and watch ted talk videos. Moreover, I listen soothing and relaxing music, watch learning and documentary videos from You Tube. Don't influence by outside, feel from inside:  I don't influence by outside. I try to feel from inside. Young people in my country are running behind good career, high-paid but secured job and social status. Basically they are highly influenced by society. But I do what I love. I feel good to do this. I write, tell my story, motivate and help poor children. Never react and act logically :  If someone says to me, \u201cyou are a jerk\u201d. I will not react, just smile and ignore this person. You should not argue with them. I have found inner peace and try to act logically. Don't compare your life with other:  All of my friends are highly successfully at their respective profession. They have worked hard and got success. I am out of the rat race of success. But it does not mean that I sit idle. I am working hard to improve my situation. I am happy with my life and don't like to compare my life with others. Life   is living now  : I try to live now. My all focus is on the present moment. I don't think about past and future. Utilizing present moment makes our life easy and better. Believe in the power of prayer :  I respect all other religion and atheism. But I believe that prayer has a positive power to change the life. I pray to god everyday. It strengthens my emotional health. Give up materialistic thinking :  As we are not monk, it may not possible to give up materialistic thinking fully. But we can be minimize it. Don't focus too much on wealth, money, shopping, new gadgets, big house and attractive partner. I focus on inner beauty of a person rather than appearance, humanity, helping people and try to make the world a better place. Life is beautiful and amazing. Just feel it. Count your blessings and not your problems. You will feel true happiness inside.

However, you have never given them adequate attention since they don\u2019t give you any monetary returns.  You are busy doing things that are useful rather than joyful.  Do something every day that give your joy and you can see the difference.   3: Get Rid of Doing What You Dislike   Pain is always more powerful than pleasure. When you are doing anything against your wishes, you suffer in the process.  Try to enjoy the things that you do. If you can\u2019t enjoy your work, change your work and do something which you love.  Choosing the right profession is a very important for happiness.   4: Be Ready for Suffering   Just like every person falls sick once in a while, you too have to suffer pain once in a while. Be ready for failures, sufferings and rejections.  When you are ready for sufferings, they cease to have any effect on you.  Remember the wise words of William Shakespeare, \u201c There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so \u201d.   Don\u2019t chase happiness.   Focus on doing the right things in your life and happiness shall never leave you.\n\nHappiness and positivity are deeply connected with each other.

That will surely change your view towards life & you will start feeling happy about the existence of life.    4. Stop Comparing yourself with others: When you compare yourself with someone who is superior to yourself in an aspect,  you start feeling unhappy about yourself. So better compare your work with your previous accomplishments and make sure you try to compete with yourself.    5.

Meet new people, give life to your passion, create your own space & make sure life is colourful in some aspects   6. Do not make one person the centre of your Happiness: This is important.

Change your frame of mind to be more accepting of things so that more things can make you happy In other words, be more accepting of, interested in, and involved with the world around you. Opportunities are missed countless times a day by those who shut themselves off from the things this world has to offer. Try things that you normally would say no to, unless they are detrimental to your or others\u2019 health and well-being. In other words, get out of your comfort zone. Socialize with people who share your likes and dislikes, aspirations and mindset People who share your values are most likely going to be long-lasting friends who will support the things you do. They might even join you in your endeavors. Good friends will not only be there for you in the long run, but everywhere in-between. Nobody likes a fair-weather friend, so don\u2019t be one; i have had plenty. If you are making friends, you are making a committment to be there for them in times of hardship and prosperity. Choose them wisely. Do not be afraid to do what makes you happy, even in the presence of others I know plenty of people who are extremely talented, hard-working, charismatic, or all three, and are afraid to be themselves because they are too nervous about what others have to say about them. Do not care about what they have to say. Do not pay them any mind. Do not entertain the notion that they are in any way important to you. Stage fright? Ignore the crowd. It sounds harder than it is because in reality, when you have an audience, all it is up there is you and your instrument\/routine\/microphone\/etc. Get so absorbed in what you\u2019re performing that you are the only thing worth paying attention to. If you like attention, find something that you can do or learn something that will impress people I personally don\u2019t like a lot of attention in person, but if you do, then go ahead. Find something that you think people will enjoy watching and learn how to do it, even if it\u2019s just a party trick. Oftentimes, it sparks conversation between you and whomever may be watching\/listening. Get out often Into the outdoors. Whether you\u2019re exercising, meditating, or just people watching, go outside. Humans require shelter, but not at all times. By staying inside all the time, you are limiting what you are exposed to, which can be detrimental to your mental\/social development and physical health which, obviously, are going to affect how happy you can be (especially in the long run). Remain healthy Exercise. As you can see, many of these tie nicely into no. 6 on this list, but this one especially. The gym provides just about everything you could possibly need to exercise whatever muscle on your body you wanted, but in my opinion, nothing compares to the great outdoors. I have had my fair share of time spend indoors, but nowadays there is nothing more mind-clearing to me than going outside and walking around the school\u2019s campus. Do not tolerate those who wish to bring you down This one\u2019s my favorite!   People may not say it, but some people don\u2019t want to see you succeed, be it out of jealousy, self-promotion, or the way you look. Something that the people on the recieving end of their comments do not always understand is that they do not have to care. Ignorance is my favorite weapon against naysayers because it is instantly effective. Someone barking nonsense at me? Sounds like TV static. They have nothing good to say or give to me; therefore, they are not worth my attention. I am not saying to be pretentious, but choose wisely those who deserve your attention, and give it to them in full.   Take these twice daily with a pinch of salt. Sometimes they will work, sometimes they will not. For most, being happy 24\/7 is nothing more than a dream, and happiness itself is something to be cherished and appreciated. Do not take for granted what you have. Be grateful for what you have and for  everything  that is given to you.   Good luck\n\nThere are countless ways to make long-lasting happiness.

Count your blessings, priviliges and appreciate your efforts. Stop blaming yourself for everything in life and stop taking control of everything in life. Be free. Watch or read one moral story a day even if you are an adult. Excellent activity. Keep clearing your doubts and questions as and when they arise. Make a quick plan for the day in morning, make a list of to do activities including pleasurable ones. No arguments, discussions, limited interaction, limited words with toxic people. No ego for them, they are dirt. Don't fill time gaps by consuming, fill them by relaxing, breathing, singing, listening to songs, talking, stretching. If you have a seating job of more than 6 hours, get up atleast 4 times and walk and stretch a little. Do some foot and head exercises after every hour and keep checking your posture. Limit social media time to an hour. Finish any task you pick up. Deal with the complexities now. There must be a lack of consistency in pleasurable activities. You can afford them, they make you happy but they must not be your master. Weekly fast. One day, don't eat anything till the evening, just water. Delay your urges as much as you can, play it like a game. (Not nature's call) 7 hours sleep, 10 hours work, 7 hours for living well. Minimmum 30 minute discussion and chilling time with family. Visit a place with positive vibrations everyday like a temple, a friend\u2019s house, a supermarket, a garden. Write one reason why your past self must be proud of you, what good you have done for your future self, and why you are priviliged today. Any negative or overwhelming thought that fills your mind for more than an hour must be addressed there and then. Write it, answer it, write a solution, stand by it, get over it. No stress policy. Don't chew countless times, but chew your food well, don't just gulp it down, your ex could be a snake but you aren't. Anubhav Jain\n\nNo papad, fried or sweet drinks. A strict no for life.

At times, think negative, something like, what if your parents, spouse, children were not there around, how empty you had felt, Or, What if you were jobless, how miserable your life had been. This will give you immense satisfaction and make you grateful for things that you have. Jot down the things in a notebook that you are grateful for in your life. Make it a practice for every day and read them aloud when you get time. Play with children. They are a source of positivity. Smile. Sometimes with no reason. Try to sleep for 6\u20137 hours every day. This will keep your mental health intact. Grow plants. It will keep you active both mentally and physically.

Half an hour brisk walk in the garden, ten minutes breathing exercise, ten minutes body exercise. Ten minutes of mindfulness. Around nine or ten, when you start with the day\u2019s work, do a five-minute seld talk session and motivate yourself. \u201cThis day is my playground, and I am a passionate player; it doesn't matter how much heat or dust it us, I will play well all day.\u201d Nothing in the universe can stop me from doing my karma. \u201cI am blessed to be able to do a lot for my life; nature hasn't made me incapable.\u201d \u201cI am a karma yogi.\u201d Make a list of all critical activities of the day, and mix the list with fun activities, entertainment, self-improvement, present responsibilities, and growth. Throughout the day, you must be clear about what to do next and not stay stuck in one thing or thought. Take tiny in between the day to clear your mind to stretch, drink water, go outside under the sun, take five deep breaths, realize what's most important for you right now, bring focus on it, and commit to getting it done. Around five in the evening, take a fifteen minutes break and listen to calming music or bhajans, sing along, feel good, and show value to your life. Evening arti in a temple, sing along, feel it, dedicate your life and its issues to God. Give half an hour or an hour towards your hobby, something that becomes the backbone of life. It can be socializing for a purpose, public service, spirituality, networking, or sports. It can be sports, cycling, cooking, music, writing, or a skill set. Growing in it with each passing day. Evening fifteen minutes walk with your companion, discussing each other's daily issues and the day. The companion could be your mother also, like in my case. Half an hour reading a book on mind, spirituality, philosophy, mental health, well-being, or a biography. Just before sleeping, thank God for one more day in life, commit to live a strong, happy, and active day if he wakes you up in the morning. Appreciate yourself for your effort, value your deeds, irrespective of results, and commit to improving and correcting your mistakes.\n\nGetting up the moment you wake up, cleaning your bed, and arranging sheets and mattresses.

This might seem basic, but if you can create a daily habit of this, and do it for a full year, you will be well on your way in your personal growth journey. Every morning when I woke up I would write down 5 goals in 5 categories. These are the things I wanted to accomplish that day. The categories were: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, relational. You can add a sixth goal too - professional.   Check out these examples below.   Physical:  Drink one more full glass of water than yesterday.   Mental:  Read an news article (or listen to a podcast) and come up with three questions to research further that are related to the article (podcast).   Emotional:  Pay attention to how I feel today, and ask myself why I feel this way. Pay specific attention to feelings the lead to anxiety, such as fear, frustration, or anger.   Spiritual:  Spend at least 15 minutes in prayer (or meditation).   Relational:  Call a friend for no other reason but to say hello and have a good conversation.   Your goals can be simple, or more complex, depending on the day and what you have going on that day, At the end of each day, before turning out the light, I would open my journal and review each of my goals for each category. I spent time writing about whether I accomplished the goals or not, why or why not, and what I need to do as my next steps.   This process, as I already mentioned, really forces self-reflection, and in turn, self awareness and personal growth and development. And while there are plenty of books out there that are excellent, I truly believe that doing this for a full year will get you started on a beautiful journey of discovery and growth.   Good luck! And have fun in the process.\n\nPersonally, I believe journaling is one one of the most effective methods. I believe this because journaling forces a person to look inward.

Each of us have come into this world have a different bouquet of talents which cannot be matched\/compared with each other. That is what makes each of us unique. Hence an elephant wanting to fly like a bird or a fish wanting to hunt like a lion are only fantasies and cannot happen. We need to convince ourselves of the facts that an individual may possess talents which we may never be able to cultivate over our lifetimes. This is the first step to self-improvement -  Knowing what we can and what we cannot do .   Identify a goal  - You need to set goals in life and work towards achieving it. It is only when you set a goal does the mind start working towards it and automatically explores arenas by which you can achieve the same. Besides, it is these goals that get you out of bed even on a gloomy day.   Identify a role model  - It also helps if you identify a role-model. Ideally such a person can be someone who is a prominent member of the society and is a highly respected individual (unless your pursuits are otherwise). It can also be one of your peers, your sub-ordinates,your boss or anyone who you believe is all that you ever wanted to be. However please be guided by point 1 - wherein certain characteristics may be unique to the individual alone and replicating it may be a waste of time.   Self-belief  - Self-improvement involves self-belief and tonnes of it. It is in times of despair that the self-belief will keep you going. An alcoholic cannot decide to leave alcohol one fine morning and be rid of his habit the next day. There will be times when the body and mind crave for it, the person may be ready to kill to consume it. But it is the belief that he can get rid of his habit that will ensure that the person quits the habit. Basically, what we are trying to do by self-improvement is changing the way in which we react to a certain thing. And Change as we all know is something that most of us fear.   Make a list  - List down all the qualities that you want to improvise upon or cultivate and write down the ways you plan on achieving it. Keep it at a place where it is easily accessible so that you can have a look at it everyday. At the end of the day, try writing down as to how or what steps you took to achieve one or more of the qualities. A word of caution however, if the list is long, DO NOT try to achieve everything together. You may end up grasping at straws. It takes time and remember anything that takes time feels good.

To start the self-improvement strategies, you need to first know and analyse yourself and your triggers.   Our bad habits do not form within a single day and same is the case with good habits that reflect our personality and behaviour in the social world.   We are most of the time unaware of the triggers surrounding us that shape and change the way we think what we think or change the way we act.   So your self improvement journey begins when you first analyse those triggers and for that you have go deep within you.

Give 100% to my marriage Walking outside\/playing with my kid everyday (no phone) Helping friends and family without expecting anything in return Building an inner scorecard that lists down things that are valuable and important to me. Whenever I start to feel envy or resentful towards someone, I look at this list. It resets my focus on what matters to me. Being responsible is more important to me than needing motivation. I don\u2019t need motivation to work hard. I am responsible for my family and that makes me work hard. Living under my means. I am careful where I spend my money. Invest my money carefully Calling my parents and siblings everyday for atleast 5 mins to check on them Helping my spouse around the house Volunteering and donating at local charities By reminding myself everyday that I will not be able to control what happens in life, but I have the control and capability to chose my response to them. Spend an hour on the weekend to review your life quickly - work, family, finances, friends, health. Getting angry and hurting people are the easiest things to do. Think twice before you do it. Understanding that people sometimes are just looking to vent and talk to you. They are not looking for advice. They are just looking for an ear to listen and a nod for acknowledgment. Women around you will always underestimate themselves. It is your job to tell them that they are intelligent and powerful and they can do whatever they want. I will meet my friend at least once i 2 weeks for a coffee or lunch. Monthly date with spouse. If you are in a leadership position at work, your job is to rally your troops by educating and supporting them. Step in their shoes to understand what they need and give them that to grow. Some people may get upset with you because they have more expectations from you. It is okay to keep distance from these people. You should live by your expectations from yourself and not someone else\u2019s. Our life is a result of the decisions that we take. Learn to think in different ways and take good decisions. Never go to your boss\u2019s office with a problem unless you have 2 solutions that you can explain to them. The only person standing between you and your goals is you. Get out of your head. Write down what you want and then go and do it. Lot of people, including myself, don\u2019t need advice to do what is right. If I want to lose weight, I need to work out and eat healthy and not watch YouTube videos on how to do it. We just need someone to tell us what to do. Avoid this trap. Just decide on the things that you need to do and go and do them. It takes a lot of time and effort to build a reputation in life. Protect it all costs. Learn to say \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201csorry\u201d more. Don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cI love you\u201d to the people whom you really love. Be obsessed with action. Be patient with results. Be optimistic. Start saving for retirement. I don\u2019t care what the real estate gurus say. Buy a house for your family. I can go on and on. You can question some of these as to how do I know they are \u201cproven strategies\u201d. May be they are not and I don\u2019t care. They worked for me. They may work for you or not. But remember, you can think about them and see what resonates with you and may help you and ignore other points. Cheers!\n\nThe quest to improve in life in whatever you are doing is one of the most profound reasons to live. Having said that, following are the proven strategies, at least for me, to improve and grow: Waking up early Workout atleast 3 days a week Journaling (brain dump) Goal setting and reflection Kiss my kid every morning and before going to sleep. Reading Take risks in career. Work hard. But always make sure you are showing your work to others - be in business or job. Give 100% to my marriage Walking outside\/playing with my kid everyday (no phone) Helping friends and family without expecting anything in return Continue Reading\n\nAnanth Subramanian Chartered Accountancy in  Finance  &  Ethics ,  Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA)  (Graduated 2016)  \u00b7  Author has  915  answers and  1.5M  answer views \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 7y\n\nOne of the most important self-improvement ideas is \u201c Never compare \u201d.

Hence an elephant wanting to fly like a bird or a fish wanting to hunt like a lion are only fantasies and cannot happen. We need to convince ourselves of the facts that an individual may possess talents which we may never be able to cultivate over our lifetimes. This is the first step to self-improvement -  Knowing what we can and what we cannot do .   Identify a goal  - You need to set goals in life and work towards achieving it. It is only when you set a goal does the mind start working towards it and automatically explores arenas by which you can achieve the same. Besides, it is these goals that get you out of bed even on a gloomy day.   Identify a role model  - It also helps if you identify a role-model. Ideally such a person can be someone who is a prominent member of the society and is a highly respected individual (unless your pursuits are otherwise). It can also be one of your peers, your sub-ordinates,your boss or anyone who you believe is all that you ever wanted to be. However please be guided by point 1 - wherein certain characteristics may be unique to the individual alone and replicating it may be a waste of time.   Self-belief  - Self-improvement involves self-belief and tonnes of it. It is in times of despair that the self-belief will keep you going. An alcoholic cannot decide to leave alcohol one fine morning and be rid of his habit the next day. There will be times when the body and mind crave for it, the person may be ready to kill to consume it. But it is the belief that he can get rid of his habit that will ensure that the person quits the habit. Basically, what we are trying to do by self-improvement is changing the way in which we react to a certain thing. And Change as we all know is something that most of us fear.   Make a list  - List down all the qualities that you want to improvise upon or cultivate and write down the ways you plan on achieving it. Keep it at a place where it is easily accessible so that you can have a look at it everyday. At the end of the day, try writing down as to how or what steps you took to achieve one or more of the qualities. A word of caution however, if the list is long, DO NOT try to achieve everything together. You may end up grasping at straws. It takes time and remember anything that takes time feels good.   ALL THE BEST!!!\n\nOne of the most important self-improvement ideas is \u201c Never compare \u201d.

This might seem basic, but if you can create a daily habit of this, and do it for a full year, you will be well on your way in your personal growth journey. Every morning when I woke up I would write down 5 goals in 5 categories. These are the things I wanted to accomplish that day. The categories were: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, relational. You can add a sixth goal too - professional.   Check out these examples below.   Physical:  Drink one more full glass of water than yesterday.   Mental:  Read an news article (or listen to a podcast) and come up with three questions to research further that are related to the article (podcast).   Emotional:  Pay attention to how I feel today, and ask myself why I feel this way. Pay specific attention to feelings the lead to anxiety, such as fear, frustration, or anger.   Spiritual:  Spend at least 15 minutes in prayer (or meditation).   Relational:  Call a friend for no other reason but to say hello and have a good conversation.   Your goals can be simple, or more complex, depending on the day and what you have going on that day, At the end of each day, before turning out the light, I would open my journal and review each of my goals for each category. I spent time writing about whether I accomplished the goals or not, why or why not, and what I need to do as my next steps.   This process, as I already mentioned, really forces self-reflection, and in turn, self awareness and personal growth and development. And while there are plenty of books out there that are excellent, I truly believe that doing this for a full year will get you started on a beautiful journey of discovery and growth.   Good luck! And have fun in the process.\n\nPersonally, I believe journaling is one one of the most effective methods. I believe this because journaling forces a person to look inward.

Be free of rigidity, you are not a princess who can't put her feet into the ground, you can do anything that anyone else can. You can learn from a homeless man, you can learn from a junior. You must freely experiment in life without ego related biloundations. For some people, silver is a better fit than gold. Some people get great ideas sitting silently on a railway station at night and not in an air-conditioned office. If you can run a factory you can also start fresh with a cart, if you had a desk job, you can roam around in the streets for work. Compare your excuses with other people's commitments, compare your perceived miseries with other people facing more hardships with a smile. Compare to grow and not to degrade your life. When you feel your working hours are high, look at the labourer working for twelve hours a day in scorching heat in return of food for his family. Have the urge to lead a better and higher life, to do every prosperous and growth based thing that you are capable of. You don't have to create comfort zones, but fill gaps in life. Always have a belief that there's still a lot more to do. \u201cI have still not done much.\u201d Most people think that they have done enough but the results don't justify their hard work and feel frustrated and demotivated. I wake up every morning with a thought that what I have done is not enough, there's a long way to go to expect any results. I must push myself more. Every day, look into life and identify what's new? what's different? what can I get in my mind? Any kowledge, skill set, experience. Some negative experiences are a new perspective towards life. Also negative experiences are an excellent way to test yourself and improve.\n\nDon't see yourself as a hard rock formed out of all the rights and truths in the world. See yourself as a sea.

Sometimes we damage our lives so badly, we cannot move back upward. This happened to me. I was an alcoholic with bipolar disorder a felony and a suspended driver's license.   My life as I knew it was over.   When even McDonald's won't hire you, you know you've hit rock bottom. I worked at an adult book store for two years until I turned myself in to the authorities because I had a warrant for my arrest. I violated probation for the felony by getting two DUI'S.   A girl told me once you're in the court system you never get out. I had never been in jail my whole life and suddenly I was in and out all the time for probation violations.   I had lost my way.   There is no question about it, I would have been living in the streets had I not had a supportive family. However, a temporary stay with Grandma until I got back on my feet turned into ten years.   After I got an expungement for the felony, I found out I was no more employable than before. The felony stays on your record for life.   Recently, I was granted a Certificate of Rehabilitation from the court, which will not guarantee, but will enhance employability. I hope to get re-employed as a psychiatric tech, which would mean going from making ten dollars an hour to thirty-five.   But I'm not holding my breath.   I used to take being a psychiatric tech for granted as something I did until I got a real career. I had just received a bachelor's degree right before getting the felony and starting on my downward spiral.   I'll never know how high I could have climbed, and it's those little what ifs that really haunt you in life.   Meanwhile, I owe thirty grand on a bachelor's degree I never got to use, and probably never will. I work as a janitor, presently.   I graduated magna cum laude and I clean toilets for a living.   Okay, I had to tell you all this before getting to the point. What I've been through is complete humiliation, loss of confidence and self esteem. I've longed for what little respect and independence I had before. I've longed for a fresh start, and twenty years later, I still do.   My mind recoils against any behavior that is self destructive now because Ive found out where it leads: to the dustbin of society.   That's why suicide was never an option for me. Why should the laws that govern the living not also apply to the afterlife (if there is one)? No, suicide might lead to a rock bottom that is too dark and bleak to contemplate.   In short, I'm tired of being a god damned loser. I'm tired of living in poverty. I want to be a winner again. I want to climb out of my rat hole.   A winner does not self destruct. A winner cultivates healthy habits and thinks positive thoughts.   The path to self destruction seemed decadent and glamorous at one time, but no longer. There is no joy in being pathetic. There is no respect or sympathy waiting for you once you land in the gutter.   The most pro-life thing I've done in the past five years is to quit smoking. I was addicted to those foul smelling , chemical laden cancer sticks for twenty-five years. I didn't think I would ever quit, didn't think I had the will power. But I did it.   I can't impress upon you the significance of this seemingly small achievement. I broke the cycle of a twenty-five year addiction. I use this to pump up my confidence. I have to believe in me again, and this is hard.   Now that I'm in my fifties and fast approaching death, the body's inevitable decay has begun. My eyesight is waning, my diabetes threatening to get out of control. I'm forced to eat right, exercise and get plenty of sleep. If not I will face dire health consequences.   The hedonism if my twenties and thirties seems like such mindless self destruction now.   You truly don't appreciate what you have until you lose it. I had much, much more than I realized, but I had to lose it all in order to see that.\n\nWell first you have to hit rock bottom. From this point there is no where to go, but either up or suicide.

Spend time with them for a few days, you will learn about their insecurity to maintain that look and other ordinary fears and insecurities, and how looks can't fulfill dreams and make you content in life.   Every extraordinary thing will break down into a simple atom if you look deeper and deeper.   Sit with yourself for an hour and first realize that you are not someone else but the \u2018you\u2019 living in this story that carries a particular meaning in the universe. Ask yourself, under your circumstances, with your consciousness, living in a unique story with its boundations and limitations, how can you be happy and content? How do you want to live this story? How do you see yourself as the main character of this story? Is it impossible to be that person? If it's possible, what's a smooth way where small steps each day can bring about a bigger change in the future?

When you engage in self-destructive conduct, you do things that injure you physically, mentally, or both. It can be anything from a minor annoyance to a life-threatening situation. Curbing self-destructive behaviors are critical for long-term success. Breaking habits is difficult, but these pointers can help you stop from being self-destructive. Break the cycle of shame:  Shame is a negative emotion directed at yourself. It can lead to self-destructive habits as a way to cope with the suffering. Continuing to engage in those habits feeds the shame-cycle and encourages further self-destructive behaviour. To break this cycle, begin by replacing little detrimental behaviours with good ones that promote pride. Accept responsibility for your small messes and adopt healthy lifestyle choices that will benefit your physical and mental well-being. Improving your self-esteem will assist you in letting go of the shame, and you will be less likely to engage in the activities that bring it back. Stop the Negative self-talk:  It's difficult to change a self-destructive habit, and negative self-talk makes it even more difficult. It's not only self-destructive to tell yourself you're weak or foolish; it's also untrue. Identifying and altering self-destructive thinking patterns can go a long way toward reducing self-destructive behaviour. Get support : The importance of peer, family, and friend support cannot be overstated. Encouragement and input from others are vital while trying to quit negative behaviour. Tell a friend, family member, or member of a support group about the behaviours you're trying to modify. Solicit their support and assistance in holding oneself accountable. Learn from your failure:  One can\u2019t change all of their self-destructive behaviours overnight, but they can learn from their mistakes and improve their strategies for the future. Consider what prompted you to engage in self-destructive conduct against your better judgement, and then consider how to avoid that stumbling block in the future. Prepare ahead of time:  Knowing what causes you to engage in unhealthy habits can help you avoid them. When you're in a difficult circumstance, keep aware of your thoughts, feelings, and attitudes while putting your coping method to the test. If it fails, use the experience to figure out what you could do differently next time. Self-destructive or dysregulated conduct does not imply that you are weak or selfish, or that something about you is fundamentally flawed. Seek the assistance of a certified mental health expert, if required. You can work through the causes and consequences of self-destructive behaviour in counselling. You have the ability to live a happier and less self-destructive existence.   I hope this helps.   For further queries, feel free to book an appointment with us.   Stay home and stay safe.\n\nHi, thanks for writing to us.   When you engage in self-destructive conduct, you do things that injure you physically, mentally, or both.

In this way, we can discern the \u2018shape\u2019 of whatever is moving and take responsibility for disarming it through our compassionate understanding.   This is a truly loving act.   Why is self-love important?   Simply put, nothing grows without love.   Love helps us evolve beyond our limitations. It offers the antidote to old past-bound patterns that no longer serve us and it helps us establish new ways of being.   Self-love has a cumulative effect. Small daily actions change the way our mind operates.   Self-awareness, compassion, empathy, appreciation, responsibility and impeccability are all acts of love that upgrade our operating system from FearOS to LoveOS.   Cultivating a loving internal environment is the single most impactful thing we can do for our own wellness, healing and growth.   What does self-love look like?   It is a cluster of small daily actions that when combined have a purifying and regenerative effect.   It is not enough to think loving thoughts, action must be taken   In the same way that we strive to create loving environments that nurture the development of our children, we must do the same for ourselves.\n\nSelf love means to be present with the whole of yourself.

You wont find any long term solutions this way.   So if you want to really be self-confident for once, stop that comparing to others and instead, only compare yourself to your past self to assess: What you are doing right and what you are doing wrong. How far you have come and the progress you have made. What you can learn from past mistakes, past relationships, and past negative or positive outcomes. Be open to your flaws and be willing to grow as a person. The difference between an arrogant man or woman and a self-confident man or woman is their willingness to grow and to accept their flaws.   Out of fear of not being enough, arrogant people tend to either deny or push aside their flaws&insecurities and pretend as if they are perfect or better than everyone else as a way to build themselves up and to grow.   Truly self-confident people on the other hand have humility and integrity in the face of adversity.   They are not afraid to accept their flaws and insecurities, to look at them objectively in order to assess and understand them, and to improve a certain way of acting or thinking for the sake of growing into the type of person they want to be. Leave your comfort-zone. Your comfort-zone is like a prison you lock yourself in.   It is when you always 'play it safe', never risk anything, avoid pain at all cost, and never dare to challenge yourself.   Unsurprisingly, this way of living cannot produce extraordinary and desired outcomes and results.   So if it is better results and outcomes in the form of: Better relationships. More attractiveness. More money. Less depression and better mental health. Better physical health. More self-confidence. Better social skills. that you want, you have to go beyond what is usual and familiar to you and learn to be comfortable with not knowing, with the unfamiliar. Understand that self-confidence can build through reference experience. Wanna know why so many motivational speakers and quotes often say:  'Embrace failure, for it is a learning lesson' or 'Every time you fall, get back up'?   That is because these people know that self-confidence comes not from acquiring many things or from getting to the end result. It comes from resilience, from knowing who you are, from trusting the process, and from reference experience  which you gather along the way.   And with each piece of reference experience, you learn to trust yourself more and also become more self-confident.   But in order to make those experiences through which your self-confidence solidifies, you have to leave your comfort-zone.   For example:   Let\u2019s say you finally gather the courage to approach and talk to that one person you have been feeling attracted to for some time.   Now there are three things that are most likely to happen here: They ignore you and you feel embarrassed. You do the approach but they reject you. You do the approach and go on an instant date and have a fun time with them. Regardless of the outcome, you will make reference experience from which you grow either way.   It may not look or feel the way you hoped it would and it may hurt a lot but, this one piece of reference experience is still of immense value and you can use that as a building block simply because you left your comfort-zone.   The more of these building blocks you gather, the more solid the foundation becomes and no storm can ever destroy the house which you build on top of the foundation.\n\nStop comparing yourself to others.

The way to make room for love is to clear out the shame.   The way to clear out the shame is to understand  why  you\u2019re ashamed. So many things came together for me this morning.   There\u2019s a story circulating about a certain mogul. Apparently, this mogul is pissed off at a certain comedian. The comedian spoofed the mogul on Saturday Night Live and like any good narcissist\u2014 The mogul is shaming the comedian.   And SNL.   And everybody.   Instead of taking the hit\u2014 Like a normal person would.   Because the worst thing  you  can ever do is make a  narcissist  feel shame. And if you do\u2014   Watch out.   Because the narcissist will take that shame\u2014 And spray it all over  you.   So, imagine what that would do to you.   As a child. Children are truth tellers.   For them, there\u2019s nothing  but  truth.   If they\u2019re mad, they\u2019re mad. If they don\u2019t like you, they don\u2019t like you. And if you\u2019re constantly shaming them\u2014 They don\u2019t like you.   The problem is, if you don\u2019t like a narcissistic parent.   And you show it.   There will be hell to pay.   So, you really can\u2019t have a truth.   Because there  will  be hell to pay. For every eyeroll. For every sulk. For every bit of\u2014 Truth.   The parent doesn\u2019t like.   So, if you\u2019re the child of a narcissistic parent, you can\u2019t  have  a truth. Which means you can\u2019t have a  self.  You can\u2019t have a self to  love .   Because all  your  self has been wrapped up in protecting the narcissist.   Who you hate.   But it\u2019s really hate\/can\u2019t hate, right? Because you  can\u2019t  hate the narcissist. The worst thing you can  do  is hate the narcissist. Because the narcissist has put all their skill into ensuring  you  know hating the narcissist makes you the worst thing in the world.   It makes  you  garbage.   Not the narcissist.   You. Because the narcissist can\u2019t  be  garbage.   So, the garbage has to be you. So, here you are.   Hating the narcissist.   A self that hates the narcissist. That can\u2019t  be  a self that hates the narcissist.   You  have been undone.   You are the self that hates the narcissist. That can\u2019t  be  the self that hates the narcissist.   So, you get to be nothing\u2014 At all. Narcissists maintain their   self-esteem by making sure  they  are never the problem.   They do it unconsciously.   If you asked the mogul what the problem was with the SNL sketch, they would say it wasn\u2019t funny.   The sketch was wrong.   Not them.   And they would believe it.   And the problem  isn\u2019t  that they would believe it. The problem is that they would externalize it. The problem is that they would have to prove  to   everyone   else  that the sketch was wrong.   By devaluing the sketch.   Instead of sitting with the very uncomfortable truth. That maybe what was wrong\u2014 Was them. So, if the antidote to shame is self-love\u2014 How do you get to the self-love?   And the answer is that you do it by clearing out the shame. By realizing your truth\u2014   Isn\u2019t shameful.   That you have been made to  feel  like your truth.   Your self.   Is shameful.   Because this self had feelings. And opinions. And desires.   For respect. And joy. And love.   And autonomy.   That  conflicted  with the feelings. And opinions. And desires.   Of the narcissistic parent.   But   that this self  wasn\u2019t  shameful. Just because it conflicted with what the narcissistic parent needed. Wasn\u2019t shameful just because it was made to  feel  shameful by the narcissistic parent.   Who, by the way, if they were really good at it, made you feel ashamed for having  any  needs. Because the only needs  you  were supposed to have.   Were the needs of the parent.   And not your own needs\u2014 At all. So, the way to self-love is through the truth.   The truth of who you are.   The truth of who your parent was.   And the truth of your annihilation  by  the parent. Who, if you grew up in a narcissistic family, attempted to validate themself by nullifying you. Who needed to invalidate  your  needs.   For respect.   For dignity.   For autonomy.   For  rage.   For every bit of feeling that made the narcissistic parent feel bad about\u2014 Themself.   By ensuring you didn\u2019t feel anything.   Weren\u2019t  anything.   The parent didn\u2019t like. So, self-love pops the shame balloon.   But you have to recognize where the shame comes from first.   If you grew up in a narcissistic family, the shame comes from your parent.   Learning to stand up for your  self \u2014 Comes from you.\n\nSelf-love is the antidote to shame.   The problem is you can\u2019t feel both of them at once.   People who were treated badly as children fill with shame.   They\u2019re like shame balloons.

Don't moan. Don't complain. Learn to be thick skinned. Make the most of what you can. Its not about how hard you can hit. Its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. You can't litter negativity everywhere and wonder why you have a trashy life. Over thinking ruins you. It ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry about futile questions and makes everything much worse than actually it is. Not everyone will make it to your future. Some people are passing through to teach you lessons in life. Never trust a person that has seriously let you down more than two times. Once was the warning, twice was a lesson and anything beyond that is simply taking advantage. (This is my personal opinion. You may choose to differ.) If you write a person \"I Love You\" and they reply you back with an emoji (No matter what that emoji is) they don't love you back. Dress to impress. Don't be emotionally attached to anyone. People change. Even your besties may probably turn into strangers one day. Just because you miss someone doesn't mean you need them back in your life. Missing is a part of getting over. Time heals everything. Your parents are your greatest assets. Respect and cherish them. What others think of you is not your problem. Numbers don't define you. Numbers like marks, money, number of cars, houses etc. Not all human attributes and characteristics (like honesty, humility, courage etc.) can be defined by numbers. People out there judging you, make their life simple by comparing you on the basis of numbers. Learn to let go, even if you are right. Smile. You don't own all the problems in the world. Eventually all pieces will fall into place. Until then laugh at the confusion, live in the moment and know that everything happens for a reason.\n\nLight travels faster than sound.

Surprisingly, the emergency no. 112 can be dialed even if the keypad is locked!  This works on all phones worldwide and is free, too!! Locked your Keys in the car:  If you lock your remote key-less car keys in the car and the spare keys are at home, call someone at home on their mobile phone from your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the person at your home press the unlock button on the spare key, holding it near the mobile phone on his\/her end. Your car will unlock, even if you are thousands of miles away!! In case of Mobile Phone Battery Flat:  All cell phones have Hidden Battery Power. To activate, press the keys  *3370#  (remember the asterisk). Do this when the phone is almost dead. Your mobile will restart in a special way with this new reserve and it will show a 50% increase in battery life. This reserve will be recharged when you charge your hand-phone next time.  This secret is in the fine print in most phone manuals, which we often skip without realizing! Disabling a STOLEN Mobile:  To check your mobile phone\u2019s serial no., key in following digits on your phone: *#06# . A 15 digits  code  will appear on the screen that is  unique to your handset . Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. If your hand-phone is ever stolen, phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the SIM is changed, your hand-phone will be totally useless. Maybe you don\u2019t get your phone back, but, it can\u2019t be used\/resold either.  This secret is in the fine print in most phone manuals. It was created for the very purpose of trying to prevent phones from being stolen . ATM PIN Number Reversal:  If you ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your PIN # in reverse order. For e.g., if your PIN No. is 1234, but you should instead put 4321. The ATM system recognizes that your PIN # is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine. The machine will still give you the money you requested for, but, unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to the location.  Beware all ATM\u2019s carry this emergency sequencer by law. It is, however, seldomly used as people just don\u2019t know about it!!\n\n5 Cell Phone Tricks!

This time has been created by life so that you understand that the path you are on needs to be abandoned as it does not give you the energy to keep you going. The fact that you arent happy, tells you that things are not right.   My experience tells me that the more you try to look for a dream\/ passion, the more you will not find it. You probably have been telling yourself that having a dream and working to realise it is very important. That is the old path\/ approach. Society tells you this , its probably not your inner voice. If you have to change your path, this approach too needs to go.   My experience also tells me that to do nothing is the best course of action. It is counter intuitive, but it worked for me. By nothing, i mean, do not look for a dream, just appreciate your life the way it is. You have done a lot, slow ,down now. Dont tel yourself what society tells you. Thats not going to work for you.   Use this opportunity to treat yourself to things that give you pleasure, let all social, job etc commitments (that you dont enjoy) go. Only do things you like. Be ruthless, be kind too yourself, dont do things you feel you \"have\" to do. Do not tell yourself to hurry up and find a dream. Give yourself as much time as you need to detox. Afterall you have been consuming all kinds of toxic societal stuff for over 30 years, accept that it is going to take time.   The dreams will come back. Prepare yourself for them. This is that time.\n\nGreat advice from all. Wonder if it makes you feel motivated to go and do any of it. My guess is not.

You are getting detached from things may be because you had a deep negative experience somewhere in past , which made you feel you cannot do anything. Your brain is trying to safeguard you by making you in comfortable zone , it really does this things , like a mother who tried to safeguard her infant . Your brain tries to remove you from situation which are very similar to those past negative experience , that had impacted on you so much . That would be one reason you are not able to do something , which is not giving you any help , but increasing your chances of depression. Talking to friends I won't suggest , because they may not know the whole part which is bothering you . You supposedly are lacking Eros which is life instict , if that is in you, you really try to create more meaning from life. Not able to settle in one place may be from the part that your inner mind is not getting a reason to get more goodness from there And gaming is a method of achieving something or creating a sense of achieving something . So that's the root cause part. Now what can we do for it.   You really have to confront yourself .   Don't explain people that you can do things., First explain to yourself , how you feel for yourself , what you think for yourself as a third party. Be generous , because it only accepts the true part. Be like a good friend to your brain and explain you feel proud that you got an achievement of not harming yourself .you did care for yourself and you tried to entertain yourself by engaging yourself in game which is all about win or loose. See if you had won many games , then you are incredible . You actually can beat problems even if it was virtual . And may be you are beating your problems through game, but why don't you go to next level ,challenging yourself beating low health , sleeplessness. Challenging yourself singing a song alone , acting as a professional in your like field . Because if you really like games and you nailed it , which most achieved people gonna fail , you are more than you think . That is not a bad of you , that is proving that somewhere inside there is a strong stubborn and a winning attitude person is evolving . Have a self talk .   I hope you will find some benefits from this . God bless you and take care\n\nThere is so much struggle inside which wants to come outside . You are getting detached from things may be because you had a deep negative experience somewhere in past , which made you feel you cannot do anything. Your brain is trying to safeguard you by making you in comfortable zone , it really does this things , like a mother who tried to safeguard her infant . Your brain tries to remove you from situation which are very similar to those past negative experience , that had impacted on you so much .

Give 100% to my marriage Walking outside\/playing with my kid everyday (no phone) Helping friends and family without expecting anything in return Building an inner scorecard that lists down things that are valuable and important to me. Whenever I start to feel envy or resentful towards someone, I look at this list. It resets my focus on what matters to me. Being responsible is more important to me than needing motivation. I don\u2019t need motivation to work hard. I am responsible for my family and that makes me work hard. Living under my means. I am careful where I spend my money. Invest my money carefully Calling my parents and siblings everyday for atleast 5 mins to check on them Helping my spouse around the house Volunteering and donating at local charities By reminding myself everyday that I will not be able to control what happens in life, but I have the control and capability to chose my response to them. Spend an hour on the weekend to review your life quickly - work, family, finances, friends, health. Getting angry and hurting people are the easiest things to do. Think twice before you do it. Understanding that people sometimes are just looking to vent and talk to you. They are not looking for advice. They are just looking for an ear to listen and a nod for acknowledgment. Women around you will always underestimate themselves. It is your job to tell them that they are intelligent and powerful and they can do whatever they want. I will meet my friend at least once i 2 weeks for a coffee or lunch. Monthly date with spouse. If you are in a leadership position at work, your job is to rally your troops by educating and supporting them. Step in their shoes to understand what they need and give them that to grow. Some people may get upset with you because they have more expectations from you. It is okay to keep distance from these people. You should live by your expectations from yourself and not someone else\u2019s. Our life is a result of the decisions that we take. Learn to think in different ways and take good decisions. Never go to your boss\u2019s office with a problem unless you have 2 solutions that you can explain to them. The only person standing between you and your goals is you. Get out of your head. Write down what you want and then go and do it. Lot of people, including myself, don\u2019t need advice to do what is right. If I want to lose weight, I need to work out and eat healthy and not watch YouTube videos on how to do it. We just need someone to tell us what to do. Avoid this trap. Just decide on the things that you need to do and go and do them. It takes a lot of time and effort to build a reputation in life. Protect it all costs. Learn to say \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201csorry\u201d more. Don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cI love you\u201d to the people whom you really love. Be obsessed with action. Be patient with results. Be optimistic. Start saving for retirement. I don\u2019t care what the real estate gurus say. Buy a house for your family. I can go on and on. You can question some of these as to how do I know they are \u201cproven strategies\u201d. May be they are not and I don\u2019t care. They worked for me. They may work for you or not. But remember, you can think about them and see what resonates with you and may help you and ignore other points.

If you are good, you can become better. Both the aspects need consistency. A key element.   Examples    * YOU are out of shape, overweight, can\u2019t say no to junk. Solution. Workout. Move your body. Motivation (yes offense to all those new year resolution makers) will only help you for a week or two. But if you commit to the regime (DISCIPLINE), you will get there eventually. You workout for a week and you see nothing. You workout for a month, you see no change. Nada. I don\u2019t know which day but your body will eventually start to change (come in shape) only if you commit to it and think of working out as a job that you MUST do each week (3\u20135 times a week at least). It worked for me.  * YOU aren\u2019t happy with your current financial situation. We\u2019ve all been there, haven\u2019t we?

This might seem basic, but if you can create a daily habit of this, and do it for a full year, you will be well on your way in your personal growth journey. Every morning when I woke up I would write down 5 goals in 5 categories. These are the things I wanted to accomplish that day. The categories were: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, relational. You can add a sixth goal too - professional.   Check out these examples below.   Physical:  Drink one more full glass of water than yesterday.   Mental:  Read an news article (or listen to a podcast) and come up with three questions to research further that are related to the article (podcast).   Emotional:  Pay attention to how I feel today, and ask myself why I feel this way. Pay specific attention to feelings the lead to anxiety, such as fear, frustration, or anger.   Spiritual:  Spend at least 15 minutes in prayer (or meditation).   Relational:  Call a friend for no other reason but to say hello and have a good conversation.   Your goals can be simple, or more complex, depending on the day and what you have going on that day, At the end of each day, before turning out the light, I would open my journal and review each of my goals for each category. I spent time writing about whether I accomplished the goals or not, why or why not, and what I need to do as my next steps.   This process, as I already mentioned, really forces self-reflection, and in turn, self awareness and personal growth and development. And while there are plenty of books out there that are excellent, I truly believe that doing this for a full year will get you started on a beautiful journey of discovery and growth.   Good luck! And have fun in the process.\n\nPersonally, I believe journaling is one one of the most effective methods. I believe this because journaling forces a person to look inward.

I highly recommend a martial arts program as taught by myself or those who taught me. A broad program of study and reading. This is what is often lacking in the \u201cteachings\u201d of the coaches out there supposedly helping young men to be better men. The mind was a priority to the best systems of Philosophy of the past. And in the warrior training schools found everywhere. Think about the officer training programs of the West. They want men capable in body but VERY capable in mind. A spiritual awareness and connectedness program with meditation and journaling. By tapping into spirit we become kinder, more open, more patient, and more thankful. Peace can become a way to settle into life and be free of the small mindedness of the masses. These are the \u201cdeeper\u201d thoughts of life. LIFE. There is much material here from both East and West. A diet that is fueling the growth. This cannot be the junk food SAD (standard American diet) garbage that is pushed on us by the government and the media. No, this must be a diet worthy of a man on a mission of personal growth. Low in processed food. More natural. Low carb. Just this very day I noticed early \u201cman boobs\u201d on my brother in law. Bummer. But he does not care for his temple with any sort of thought or plan. A goal of financial freedom through money wisdom.

Consistency Over Intensity   Whether you are trying to overhaul your life completely or grow in more subtle ways, consistency matters more than intensity.   While personal growth often happens in a sporadic way, it\u2019s only through maintaining consistency with the actions you choose to improve yourself with that you\u2019ll ever see those bursts of improvement and growth. I could go and do the hardest workout I can imagine but if I only do one intense workout and then don\u2019t continue to train, I won\u2019t see any of the self-improvement benefits of regular exercise.   Many people mess this up when starting a fitness routine, but the same goes for trying to learn any new skill. Practicing an instrument once for hours is not going to mean the instrument is mastered.   When we\u2019re inspired to grow and make a change, the early enthusiasm makes it easy to overdo it, take on too much, and then not remain consistent over time.   Choose Your Focus   In order to successfully grow and create the change that you want, you also need to focus your attention.   Trying to take on too many self-improvement projects all at once means making very little progress on any and all of them. Instead do what is called a Tournament of Priorities and narrow down what you\u2019re working on at one time. Before I had started up my business I was still very focused on competing at the top level of my sport of strongman. This demanded incredible consistency with training to make progress and also a ton of focus for training sessions that would often last three or four hours. When I started my business, my focus had to shift away from sports and this was a new chapter of personal growth for me.   Keep The Horizon Close   As much as possible practice breaking down big goals into smaller actions.   Most personal development goals are on a very long timeline and most of us can only keep our attention on a goal for 90 days. So instead of trying to chip away at one long and seemingly never ending project, make sure that you can define an endpoint a few months from now. This is why signing up for a fitness competition works so well. Sign ups usually start a couple of months out and you focus your training on that end goal before starting on the next one. If it is a very long horizon goal in a different domain you\u2019re working on, find the logical milestones within it. A book that you want to write has individual chapters to be completed as projects along the way. Starting a business has its own checkpoints like putting together the business plan, securing funding, building out the physical location or designing the website, and so on.   Any way that you can envision growing and developing yourself has these waypoints to help guide you along the way or change directions as you transform.\n\nPeople often don\u2019t give themselves enough credit for how much they can change and grow through hard work and consistent action.

Forgetting about self-help can be a smart decision if you ask me, especially if you\u2019re fed up with it. Once I left, I started feeling much more relaxed with anything I did.

Without delay, all the students jumped into the stream, one after the other.   The temperatures were low in the vicinity because of the snow-laden peaks nearby, but the stream was quite hot.   A few students shouted in pain and jumped out immediately.   A few felt pain but still followed their guru's orders and thought that bathing in the hot stream would be for their betterment in the cold weather.   A few felt heat but enjoyed the warm bath and felt relaxed. The sensation of warmth and that little pinch made them feel good.   Those who stayed for long ended up enjoying the warm bath and felt good about their Guru.   The guru called them together and said,  \u201cask these three questions to yourself to understand your personality. How sharp did you feel the pain and warmth of water? How vulnerable are your senses to any stimuli? How did you perceive that sensation? How much you were affected by it? YOUR MIND'S PERCEPTION OF THE SENSES. Your reaction towards it. Your action, karma, response, refraining, attitude. YOUR RESPONSE. How do you take it as an experience? YOUR LEARNINGS, OBSERVATIONS, AND FEELINGS ABOUT THE INCIDENT, LIFE, AND YOURSELF. He brought ahead one student and said-   His mind is vulnerable to the senses as he shouted when he jumped into the water, and his expressions displayed pain; this shows a lack of previous experience with warm water; also, he has been raised with care and not strength, and naturally, his body is soft. He perceived warm water as pain and a threat to himself. There was fear in him for the water.   His reaction to that negative stimuli was controlled, balanced, and mature. I know he valued my orders, believed in me, and had enough inner strength to not jump out; he stayed inside, shut his eyes, and focused on my orders to become comfortable. As time passed, his body didn't burn but felt comfortable.   He stayed the longest inside, which means he is comfortable now and has taken it as a positive experience for bearing pain, standing at high temperatures, having faith in his guru whose command didn\u2019t cause loss to him, and being adamant about his responsibilities and commitments.   Judge yourself through your response.\u201d   Guru gave them some time to think.   Each one analyzed their response-How they felt? How they reacted? What they learned about themselves and the world?   He started speaking again-   \u201cAsk these three questions for any event or stimuli you face in life to judge, correct, and improve yourself.   For example, if someone shouted at you-   Did you feel bad for yourself? Did you feel neutral? Did you laugh those words off? How sharp, penetrating, and strong were their comments to you? An irrelevant vibration that you ignored, pierced you like a sword, or it simply appeared to be a sound wave of an immature person.   Your reaction. How maturely you responded? Whether you were anxious, impatient, engaged in altercation and immediately attacked him with words, hit him, or acted maturely and walked away, or maturely calmed him down through wisdom and silence.   How you perceived that incident and took it as an experience, a memory? Whether hat person is immature, you are a strong, vulnerable, or weak person. What do you think about that person, life, and yourself after that event? Were you wrong or right? How would you meet that person the next time? How should you have reacted? How would you react in the future? This event would also affect your collective thoughts on how are people in general.   A few negative interactions with people perceived in a wrong way would make you socially anxious. You need to take the correct learnings from each event.   Use these questions to judge your mindset and maturity, to correct, stabilize and improve.   Balance your traits. Lose weakness and gain strength. Aim at improvement, betterment, and prosperity.\u201d   Be aware, observe, understand, think, evaluate.   Think neutrally and progressively, beyond ego and conditioning. Think inward and outward.   Decide what's best for you. Correct, strengthen, realise, refrain.   practice, and keep evaluating yourself.
